124149619252_10153246130479253	"But is Chipotle even really concerned about seed breeding techniques or even pesticide traits that are involved with some GMOs? As part of their switch they changed from using soybean oil to sunflower oil.[3] When asked about the type of sunflowers now being used on Twitter they responded that, Our sunflowers have an herbicide-tolerant trait as a result of natural cross-breeding, not genetic manipulation.[4]  Herbicide tolerant sunflowers are a product of BASF.[5] These sunflowers were bred to be resistant to BASFs Beyond, an imazamox based herbicide. When compared to Roundup, Beyond appears to be more toxic to bees, less biodegradable,[6] and as an ALS inhibitor appears to be more prone to the development of resistant weeds.[7] The sunflowers are also no more natural than the genetically modified soybeans that they have replaced.  BASF used a process known as mutagenesis to breed their sunflowers. Their seeds were doused with ethyl methanesulfonate and sodium azide to alter their DNA.[8] Ethyl mathanesulfonate is a possibly carcinogenic compound that produces random mutations in DNA.[9] Sodim azide is an extremely toxic compound used as a biocide and in airbag systems. It is lethal to humans at only 0.7 grams.[10] The Beyond sunflowers even require tillage or the use of glyphosate anyways.[11] A direct apples to apples comparison is kind of difficult though to be fair. Comparing glyphosate resistant soybeans with imazamox tolerant sunflowers would probably require years of research to evaluate environmental and health differences. The one conclusion that we can draw is that Chipotle is not doing this for any reason other than to profit off of the current GMO paranoia.  http://welovegv.com/entries/gmos/chipotle"	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Also close to the beans with pork. When the girl was serving the person next to me i noticed that the juice of the meat poured a little on the tofu, and some of the juice of beans with pork also poured on another vegeterian option. I would suggest chipotle to completely separate  all the vegan/vegeterian options from the meat and beans. Literally on another side of the hot food bar. I was upset because i wasn't able to try the tofu after seeing that. LOOK OUT PEOPLE!!! (vegeterians/vegans) i haven;t eaten there because of that."	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

And guess what, this backstabbing sorry excuse of a food chain is not one. If you want to know FACTS, talk to a professor  at a university that deals with whatever sector of agriculture you have a question about. If you want to know how animals are handled and cared for, go to a farm and ask questions. Ask them why they do this or that with their animals and I can bet you there is a logical answer behind every question and it involves the betterment of the livestock. I am tired of uninformed and misguided people attacking my life style when I never come to your place of work and tell you I don't like what you are doing and you need to do it differently. Why doesn't everyone just stop and be thankful that they live in a country with the safest food supply in the world and that there's someone out there doing the dirty work to produce your food so you don't have to. Without food you don't exist, with out farmers and ranchers you don't exist.

I'd welcome anyone to come see it anytime, I have nothing to hide.  Chipotle can brag about their food with integrity but that's really bragging about their lack of understanding."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

At Chipotle, a single burrito with one meat and one filling is up to 1580 calories and thats without a side or a drink. Add chips with guacamole and a drink and you are up to 2620. You'll have a heart attack before you leave the restaurant; but hey, at least there aren't any GMOs in there, right?  The chips and the drinks still have high fructose corn syrup in them and thats GMO.

124149619252_10152004082504253	"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

Luckily within weeks a Chipotle was completed. A half block down from Qdoba so we have returned to our weekly trips to Chipotle even walking in the snow to get our weekly fix. We march right passed the front of Qdoba & into our Chipotle that is just finishing our meal we have ordered on the iPad app & sit down and enjoy our meal! Thank you Chipotle for a quality product and a new location so we could add state #4 to our list of Chipotle visits :)	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

If the date isn't going well, it won't be dragged out across a three hour, several-course-meal.  However, unlike meeting at a coffee joint, Chipotle Mexican Grill has burritos.  Second, it's delicious.  Both parties will be in a great mood just eating a delicious burrito or bowl.  This will allow both parties to become better acquainted.  Third, the minimalist design of the place is just hip enough to show that you're a person who knows how to have a good time, while at the same time, a person who knows the value of a dollar.  :)"	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

124149619252_10152250518069253	Frozen burritos at the grocery store are a large market. Is Chipotle going to ever make a commercial frozen food burrito line. They would be larger than the other burritos and also have a point of difference in the quality of the ingredients and the more humane free range treatment of the livestock. The current sales data of ingredients can determine the most common ingredients requested as toppings to create what the toppings would be. I bet they will sell well I want free gift cards for life if my idea is used! Ive lived on frozen burritos!	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

I now live in Cedar Park TX and my family and have eaten at the closest Chipotle in Austin hundreds of times.  We will be taking a long break after having not one but two bad experiences now.  The helpful ladies and men that used to serve us are now all gone.  Replaced with high school aged kids.  Not a problem except they ran out of beans so everyone in line waited for the beans to be made ready, as I was approaching to order they ran out of rice with none ready to replace, we waited an additional 10 mins for the rice and then I was able to order.  Now they ran out of vegies to make my borrito ""fajita"" style.  Agian none were cooking so I waited....... vegies are done we can complete your order sir, ""oh you want steak""  They ran out and you guessed it.  I waited nearly an hour total to get my food and when I did they had the portions all wrong with too little rice mixed with too much sour cream so it was a very wet and icky combo.  I hate that they have gone so far down hill.  I will come back and i hope that they get it right because when its been good its been the best!  BTW Chipotle if you are concerned at all or listing, please clean your store, I saw liiteral fur growing on the top of the AC Chase and psuedo ceiling fan that holds the lighting for the store.  I know it is dust but obviously had not been cleaned in a year or more.

Chipotle said the dip could be at risk because of global climate change. News hit the web today that Chipotle said it could temporarily pull guacamole and other salsas from its menu if ingredients are affected by global climate change. The revelation came in a paragraph contained in an annual financial filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It says: ""Increasing weather volatility or other long-term changes in global weather patterns, including any changes associated with global climate change, could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients... In the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients, we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items, such as guacamole or one or more of our salsas, rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients."" The company told CNN that guacamole fans really shouldn't worry. ""This is nothing more than routine risk factor disclosure. The sky is not falling,"" said Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold. ""I wouldn't read too much into this."" - See more at: http://m.whio.com/news/news/local/chipotle-guacamole-could-go-probably-not/nd6DR/#sthash.HUn9SIKf.dpuf"	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

But Farm Aid not only helps the hungry it also helps the farmers out there who are not willing to let quality over quantity win. SO please remember that Chipotle was founded on a simple concept with quality ingredients. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!!	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

The last time I went there it was 45 minutes before they closed they were out of corn, onions and bell peppers, chicken and black beans, the funny thing is that was most of the stuff I wanted. Myself being in the service industry understands about wanting to go home as soon as possible after work or have a drink or two. But I also know that this would be unacceptable in the establishment that I work at. In short my family and I will never go back to the Irving Texas location on Beltline witch is sad because we live so close, but I guess we'll have to drive to the Las Colinas location Instead to see if they can do any better.

But the animals they exploit are living, feeling individuals just like you and I, and they are brutally killed simply for being born different than us. There is nothing humane about removing animals from their natural environments, separating them from their families, putting them into cages, mutilating their bodies, and ultimately killing them. People generally do good and have big hearts, but sometimes our world tricks good people into doing bad things. The land that would become America had a proud tradition of slavery for 400 years. I think you know that this is wrong, and that it is wrong to oppress another living, feeling individual simply for being different. So please, make a stand for the animals. They need our voice.

I watched car after car pass me. I was cold, hungry, upset, tired. Finally one car stopped and offered help. Very nice man. He gave me a ride into town. I mentioned that I was hungry and when we reached town, he pulled into a TACO truck and before I could say anything, he said it was his father's food truck! I couldn't even tell he was Mexican!! I felt so weird inside. Angry. But, I was starving! So, as much as was pissed off, I decided to just eat the free meal he offered.   IT WAS THE MOST AMAZING FOOD I EVER HAD!!! I fell in love with Tacos instantly!!!! It changed my life!!! In the moment, I knew I could not hate anymore. I love and respect everyone now.   Who knew a taco could change a man's heart?"	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

As a vegan,  I love Chipotle,  However Chipotle social media team should consider that cross contamination is happening.  Fellow vegans finding chicken and other meat in their sofritas. Employees using the meat spoon to serve.  Also the cheese and dairy sometimes taints the guac. With  the speed and volume with which the food is served,  Measures should be taken to ensure this does not happen. For some,  it's a choice,  for others it's allergies.  I can't tell you how many times I avoided guac because there was cheese or sour cream In  the tray.  What if the beef was tainted with e coli and an employee used the spoon to serve sofritas?  Bad business practice.  Please take note.  Melbourne Florida Thank you."	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

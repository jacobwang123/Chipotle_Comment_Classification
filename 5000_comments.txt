124149619252_10152262999499253:Steve. You. Jerk. Just because that lady thought I was the dude who orders vegetarian burritos doesn't make me the guy who orders vegetarian burritos. I just have a doppelgänger who doesn't know how to order food right.
124149619252_228303190552746:Thanks chipotle!! After seeing the movie food Inc. I vowed not to eat fast food, over a year ago I discovered you and your food is fast, but it isn't fast food. Thank you for providing food with integrity!! And opening a new Burlington MA store right near my work!!!
124149619252_10151086390274253:CRAP!  I've tried to avoid all of the news pages so that I would be surprised with the results when I watch the match tonight!!! Where was the spoiler alert?  I still love Chipotle and Misty! :)
124149619252_261338423981855:Thank you Chipotle, while other fast food companies are sticking their nose in social issues they should stay out of, your company is taking real steps to fix our broken food production industry 
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl with brown rice, black beans, carnitas, mild salsa, corn, sour cream (or cheese depending on mood), and lettuce.
124149619252_10153041044599253:That's great... changing tables are cool, too! C'mon Chipotle! Stop making me change my baby in the car!
124149619252_10152883478794253:Never liked the food & now I hate what you allowed your establishment to represent. #isupportThinBlueLine
124149619252_153487264707094:What wonders you create Shiny little tin foil I open you up and surprise There's a tasty burrito there just for me What power you have, little tin foil I bow to you
124149619252_10153246130479253:This is a great step, Chipotle  Thank you..    However, what about the GMO laden feed that is fed to the chicken and pigs?  That still makes it's way into our bodies.  When will you stop serving that poisoned meat?
124149619252_10152407734029253:Moms won't tolerate corporate cowardice when it endangers our children and families. #GunSense #BurritosNotBullets
124149619252_10152406485254253:I'm disappointed that you are not including any Mexican American authors and will no longer eat there.
124149619252_454413931302356:Too bad your company has seen fit to get involved in politics. I have enjoyed the burritos, and enjoy having them made to order, but now that you have pulled your sponsorship from the Boy Scouts of America because of someone's political agenda, I will now take my business elsewhere. I am also encouraging all of my friends and family to avoid your restaurants as well. I am sorry you have taken this stance.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito: quesadilla style, double wrap, steak, brown rice, pinto  beans, corn, lettuce. Guacamole on the side.
124149619252_10151058843154253:What makes it so special is it looks like it makes its own power.  Where can I find the answer?  Maybe I could ask at one of the 2 Chipolte Mexican Grills in Rochester MN.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie bowl: brown rice, black beans, veggies, poco, corn, guacamole, lettuce. My husband gets the same. $13.53
124149619252_10150262089049253:I loveeeee chipotle.... But that one I go to that is two block from my home.... There is one lady in particular she is so mean she gets upset is we ask for litle extra hot sauce or rice.. We don't mind paying for it :( 
124149619252_10152406485254253:Way to go Chipotle! Going to have dinner tonight to show my support of your decision.  Common sense won!
124149619252_135356053201187:Pretty sure the racist comment didn't need to be aired and the guy should be kicked off uncalled for NBC!
124149619252_185864848093833:More companies need to be more like Chipotle. I just opt out of eating meat altogether because the whole process just disgusts me, however the majority of people in the US don't. Glad to see a big restaurant chain being an example of caring about the health of Americans.
124149619252_10153246130479253:GMOs are 100% SAFE. How about serving foods and beverages with less added sodium and sugar? Now THAT would be a healthy change!
124149619252_10151839071994253:Oh and for your title: "Wir haben jetzt in Frankfurt geöffnet" That's probably, what you mean. Hard German grammar
124149619252_10151024826814253:any bowl with all the goods....brown rice, black beans, sour cream, cheese, veggies, hot salsa and guac!!! YUM!!!!!
124149619252_100721619944214:YO!!!! $2.00 for extra chicken....for my chicken bowl??!?!!?! I mean....what kind'of chicken is this anyways?? It's chicken for crying out loud!!! Jeeeez-man!!! It's freak'n- -chicken-on-the-go!!! When the hell did chicken become the lobster of the food industry?? ...and the first time I tasted lobster...it wasn't even that good! Dayaaaaaammmmnnnn!!!! Yo I cant do Chipotle' like I use to, because even though it's good-to-go....it's still just a burrito....or a burrito in a bowl...without the tortilla.  That's my 2 cents! Make it ez! Keep it ez!
124149619252_10153240834269253:Dear Chipotle: Because of your recent stand against GMO foods, I will not be returning to your business.  Because you have given into the forces of science denial, you have joined the dark side, and I can't support that.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie Salad - romaine, brown rice, black beans, mild and medium salsa, guacamole and dressing. Best vegan meal :)
124149619252_10153656854824253:I also wish they would take out the red onions, that's the only reason I won't get guac because otherwise I love guac!
124149619252_10152786808474253:Only 2 people got something other than carnitas, and one of them got "2 carnitas tacos, 1 chicken" lol....
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl:white rice, fajita veggies, steak, mild salsa, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce. Yummy had one today.
124149619252_10152108930454253:I am so saddened to know that in 9 minutes, I will NOT be enjoying a delicious burrito from the Chipotle Mexican Grill that resides across the street from me.  Why 2014... WHY must you begin with an absence of GREATNESS?!?!     :'(
124149619252_10151486609219253:Sadly the last burrito I bought from Chipotle near my house was TERRIBLE! I used to LOVE them, but this one was tiny, hardly any steak, rice, or beans.. And it didn't have the same great spicey flavor that I used to love! What happened guys? Budget cuts?
124149619252_10153083685269253:Too bad their salasa doesn't look like this anymore! Their new salsa tastes and looks like it came a jar from the grocery store :-(
124149619252_163075200578:I wish there was a Chipotle here in the Amarillo Texas area. I'm from Denver and I love this restaurant
124149619252_10153066985824253:Fargo never had a Chipotle until now? Lol.. For real? In St. Paul there are like 5 close to me. Probably 20+ in the metro.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Open the store here in Amarillo already! It's been a year now. It's built, there stuff inside. Just open the thing already.
124149619252_10151486609219253:In all seriousness... Bowl with white rice, black beans, fajitas, mild salsa, guac, lettuce.  GF/DF and delicious!
124149619252_10153262094399253:Timothy funny that when I asked for the recipe a few years ago because I thought I was allergic to something in their guac, they told me it was a secret recipe and could not tell me. now they are telling the world.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken, brown rice, black beans, tomato, corn, and lettuce. Burrito and burrito bowl- mix em up lol 
124149619252_105860719543628:for Emma Canto Felicia Mabe Leah Stulich Laura Dailing Rice Jena Marie Heather Narvell....don't miss it!  lol
124149619252_10153888324619253:Please send me my Chipotle loyalty rewards card. I eat Chipotle chicken burrito bowl every other day.
124149619252_182076481805338:Can he test market at my Chipotle in Alpharetta, GA?   I am a Master Burrito Ambassador and would love to taste test any new samples... been doing it every week for the past 9 years+.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I bet almost all these people complaining about the tofu have poor eating habits and are malnourished in one way or another ????  Just cause this is 'MURIKA doesn't mean you should treat your body like a waste bin ????
124149619252_10152453918534253:Got Chipotle from Deer Park the other night. Rude staff and my veg burrito bowl was gross. Ended up throwing most of it away. Used to love your food but for the price, it's not worth it anymore.
124149619252_199537401806:still waiting on the very practical Ithaca, New York.  Ithaca College, Cornell University, bunch of old school hippies.  It all makes sense.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Salad, lite rice, pork, fresh tomatoes, corn salsa, sour cream and lots of lettuce. Oh, and a tortilla on the side. I luv my Chipotle. I loved it in NY.  When I moved here to OH in 09' and found the Chipotle around the block from my new apartment, I knew I was home.
124149619252_341532579201452:You need to have more options available for those with dietary restrictions (like brown rice, no cheese, bowl, etc).
124149619252_10152250518069253:All you people are fools. If you did not see Chipotle as the link then you shouldn't have believed it. #SHEEP #FREELOADERS
124149619252_10151486609219253:Variety of meats depends , rice type depends on day, beans depends,  red & green &  hot & corn salsa, lettuce, and finally  guacamole I am okay with it being extra.
124149619252_10151719407409253:I tried using google three times and it didn't work. Went to IE, and it worked. I've had issues with adventurrito since minute one. Definitely, not user friendly or tech friendly.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Thanks Beth Hersey- Leamon! I would've felt silly going in there and showing them that. Lisa Leeper, you should check this out
124149619252_10153009001449253:Having my Sofritas bowl as I type... Can't taste any difference, it's actually good! My 13 yr old son who is rather picky liked it too....   Said he liked it better than when I get it with chicken.
124149619252_10151961054499253:hey nestor, yeah we are not gmo free yet, we have sunflower oil and soybean oil in our restaurant. our soybean oil, which is in most of our food items, IS NOT gmo free. but the company is working its way toward gmo free
124149619252_10153009001449253:Like so many others, I waited in a long line only to be told they were out of sofritas. The girl said I could get another kind of meat. I'm long vegetarian, the ONLY reason I went out of my way to go to Chipotle was to try the sofritas.  Sorry guys, I'm no longer interested and won't be back no matter what specials you offer.
124149619252_160584150738666:put one in Copenhagen and Stockholm please!! They have no Mexican there at all and when i go to visit family, I am always so excited to come home and have Chipotle!
124149619252_10153009001449253:FALSE advertising. We DID order the Sofritas,  they told us they were sold out and the counter guy said they wouldn't honor the free burrito promotion deal from our alternate order!  Boo!  #chipotlefail
124149619252_10150719072154253:Um, Easter is for all believers. Catholic has nothing to do with it. Even more so it symbolizes Christ's sacrifice for us that we may now have full access to God. No more earthly priests or sacrifices. Just us and God!
124149619252_10151809543439253:Ooo!  Can I use my weekly free burrito coupon for one, since I won the 20 years of free burritos?  Wait...I did win the 20 years of free burritos, didn't I?
124149619252_10152632602189253:Jeff Kalsbeek, Phil Hohner...I bet you guys can guess which one reminded me of you!! Lol miss you fools!
124149619252_10153246130479253:So either it's not really GMO free (good luck finding non GMO corn) or they somehow are growing their own non GMO corn and their prices are going to go through the roof. This is a marketing move. Nothing more.
124149619252_10151024826814253:stop calling the pico hot sauce and i will come back! it drives me freakin nuts. every time i used to go in i would be like, "hot sauce please." they always would respond, "mild, medium, and hot" where the frick is mild? oh, you mean pico de gallo, you're an idiot...
124149619252_10153009001449253:Great idea... But you're sold out of sofritas at 3:30 pm! One very unhappy customer! Please plan better next time you attempt a promotion.
124149619252_156053474470:you should deliver in fresno california because i would have chipotle a lot more and i know my friends would do the same
124149619252_10151307314369253:I love it! This is yet another reason why Chipotle is my favorite (with no second choice anywhere close) restaurant!! Well done.
124149619252_199537401806:EVERYWHERE!!!! Chipotle should be like starbucks - one on every corner!!!   Please put one in Livermore, CA! We have an adorable downtown that needs a burrito landing!
124149619252_10152250518069253:What kills me is that you all get mad for not getting a free gmo burrito and not that is got gmo products, humanity is getting to Idiocracy levels...
124149619252_10153489422339253:The Dark Act is passing through the Senate. This will remove all ingredient lists from our food. DARK - Denying Americans the Right to Know. We must stop this! Call your Senators!!  GMO FREE USA
124149619252_10152571682409253:I want Chipotle. If they weren't closed at 10, when I get out of work, I'd totally go eat there in a few lol.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I will continue to support this amazing company for their humane business practice in terms of obtaining meat from responsible producers. I love the softritas, so thanks Chipotle for offering us vegetarians a great option to meat. It's really good!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Last I checked, you are still serving Coke made from HFCS from GMO corn.  Go all the way, or go home.
124149619252_10153830182809253:So if Chipotle is closing February 8th to teach employees better food handling, does this mean It's really not important? This should be done ASAP not a month + later. Should have done it all along.
124149619252_10152262999499253:...how are you mad about this? You can still eat your meat, just dont eat this. I for one am happy to see a chain like you supporting the need for alternative options, thank you :)
124149619252_10152104828699253:I have to Travel 6 hours to my nearest Chipotle Mexican Grill and have done it many times Please bring some to Canada! Thank You
124149619252_109031815838831:I got a free pop once. But several 3 burrito weeks in a row didn't earn me a free one in Parma, OH :(
124149619252_122372141178171:I'm indifferent about Jamie Oliver, I agree that school lunches need to be healthier, but seriously removing flavored milk from schools is not the right answer, study after study shows that when chocolate milk is removed as an option overall consumption of milk decreases. In addition the benefits of milk, especially at that age, outweigh the added sugar. I think its best to have kids drink milk of any variety that has nutritional value vs. the alternative which is sugary juices and soda.
124149619252_10150719072154253:It's nice to give your families a day of to spend with there families. Not just Catholics celebrate easter Sunday. 
124149619252_10152407734029253:Good luck waiting for the police, signs and corporate policies won't do much against a madman. http://youtu.be/e9NDnqS5h9k
124149619252_115365598544868:You know if you want a standard "consistent size" of food when you go just tell the person how you want it done. Ex. Less rice & more tomatos instead of being rude & being on the phone or ignoring the staff!!!  Never ever had a problem, ask & you shall receive!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito in a bowl chicken or pork lettuce veggie white rice cheese corn salsa extra sour crem chips and salsa and a soda yummy
124149619252_199537401806:Brainerd mn, I work at taco bell but I have to drive over an hour and a half for my beloved chipotle!
124149619252_10151024826814253:After the newest Chipotle in town mistreated us , lied and then mistreated us again never ever again.
124149619252_10150732816629253:Started from the bottom and now you guys are taking over. I freaking love your place. Keep up the good work
124149619252_10152262999499253:Yeah and now I can't go anymore :( this is what happens to all your number one customers who previously came to a SOY FREE resteraunt with a soy allergy
124149619252_10153246130479253:But you still serve a soy-based alternative which is not only GMO,  but which few of your stores do anything to prevent cross contamination.  Soy is one of the.top food allergies, and due to the lack of training it is not safe for people with soy or peanut allergies to eat at chipotle as the "meat substitute" can easily contaminate all other products.
124149619252_194708182065:Wow, I feel spoiled to have 3 locations within 15 minutes from my apartment. Franchises need to happen !
124149619252_10153602183249253:I can't believe how dumb people are. If you believed this, please avoid the voting booths when the time comes, because you are what's wrong with this country
124149619252_10153656854824253:I need to talk to the people at the market- that i need our avocados to look just like that Richard SubZero Vilabrera Jr.
124149619252_10151058843154253:When will you ever come to Germany? We have our fill of bad Mexican restaurants and fast-food joints here!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Too bad no one at Chipotle has taken any basic science classes.  If you don't want to eat GMO food, you will starve to death.  Hey Chipotle, good to know you can be so easily blackmailed by people who are willfully stupid.
124149619252_10153240834269253:Ugh.  All food is "genetically altered".  Another misleading headline and company bowing to Big Organic and it's minions.
124149619252_10151089035244253:University of Dayton, Brown St. Friendly staff, warm and fresh food, nice portions, and the customers are the most diverse in Dayton.
124149619252_10153246130479253:GMOS are not simply hybrid crops.. Do your research. If you want to be informed, be all the way informed.
124149619252_10151058843154253:Congratulations Chipotle.  Great food, good staff and Environmentally efficient buildings. You guys set the mark for the rest.
124149619252_10153888324619253:Chipotle Mexican Grill, I got my text yesterday but had to do a factory restore on my phone today.  Any way to get it resent?
124149619252_10152406485254253:The funniest thing of it all is everyone is acting like chipotle is great food. It's not. Add salsa to any Mexican based dish and it's ok.
124149619252_10151908068909253:I remember when it used to be free if you dressed up like a Chipotle item. This is still a good deal:)
124149619252_10153246130479253:US forced to import organic corn and soy to meet growing Non GMO demands. Where's the Farm Babe now?....lol.  http://www.cornucopia.org/2015/04/u-s-forced-to-import-corn-as-shoppers-demand-organic-food/
124149619252_10151089035244253:The current Uptown Albuquerque location (6810 Menaul Blvd. NE) is great, with fast, friendly service. Can't wait for the other two Albuquerque locations under construction to actually open!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Crispy chicken tacos:  brown rice, chicken, tomato salsa, corn salsa, lettuce!  guac & chips on the side!
124149619252_10152236327209253:Thanks, Chipotle! I used to love Qdoba (still delicious) but the ethics of your company are top-notch. Encouraging all of my friends and family to grab a bite to eat from you guys! Thanks again! (Pittsburgh, PA)
124149619252_10153489055424253:If you haven't apologized to your girlfriend or wife with Chipotle Mexican Grill and roses you're wrong.
124149619252_156053474470:I just can't wait till next fall when there is a Chipotle here at Virginia Tech, making the college ranked #1 for food in the nation even better :)
124149619252_10152250518069253:Wow! There's some serious bile being spewed in the comments... I'm over here thinking, "... drag" and other people are saying they won't go back to Chipotle because SOMEONE ELSE posted a scam on Facebook!?
124149619252_10150256700954253:I so want a Chipotle near Clarion, PA (I-80).  I used to go to the original by DU in Denver...those were the days!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl, white rice, pinto beans, hot red sauce, lettuce, guac, sour cream, & cheese... Tabasco chipotle & lemon on the side. With chips... deeeelish.
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken, lettuce,onion,green peppers,black beans, fresh salsa, cheese, sour cream and guacamole plus  chips
124149619252_10153246130479253:If you want to eat gmos folks, shut up and eat em. A lot of us don't and we shouldn't be rediculed for feeling that way.
124149619252_10152949800154253:No more Chipotle for this family.  Your employees are the face of your business.  No thanks.  We will just go somewhere else from now on.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thank you for doing this. Wish we had stricter requirements in the US, glad you didn't have to be told but took the initiative. You have my business
124149619252_109031815838831:I meet my husband at the same Chipotle for lunch at least once a week.  Frequently more often.  We eat dinner at the one near our house frequently.  Never, ever, ever have we been offered a free meal. :(  What's the secret??  We eat there so often that we know which employees work at the various locations.  Oh well.  Got read the riot act about needing to cut down on sodium so we'll probably have to cut out way back on Chipotle, but it is good.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Thanks Chipotle for offering a promotion on ONE item and then not having enough to get through the day.  VERY disappointed.  :(
124149619252_247886528567719:the chipotle at arundel mills is AMAZING!!! and the manager is the besttttt!!!! i go there all the time just for chipotle!!!! yummmm
124149619252_10152250518069253:Jason Angus sorry! I really just saw it and figured it was true. Why they do that I don't understand.
124149619252_10151267410249253:My daughter LOVE'S Chipotle. She could eat it everyday for dinner. But that could get alittle expensive. 
124149619252_10153246130479253:Laughing while reading comments of people that are supposedly upset that gmo's are being removed from Chipotle because they supposedly want gmo in their food because supposedly gmo's are safe LOL your not fooling anyone.
124149619252_10152840149194253:OH, Nicole Cartica / Josh. Now I have to go tomorrow. I was thinking about it anyway since I will be in the mall.
124149619252_163075200578:Finally a Chipotle near my house! Thanks chipotle for making all that money for me. I have to buy more stock!
124149619252_10152408378957741:Only restaurant we have allowed my 2 year old daughter with severe allergies to milk, egg, and peanuts eat. Thank you!
124149619252_199537401806:OMG YEEESS!!!! I've been complaining about there being no Chipotle since I moved to the area!! Greatest news ever!! 
124149619252_10152996855759253:Just learned your suspend Pork Carnitas because your vendor violated your "raised responsibly" standards. Thank you for putting high food standards and doing the right thing over profits. You have my business. Looks like a burrito today for me.
124149619252_10153257383459253:If you were truly about helping others, you wouldn't have removed some of your GMO ingredients. I say some, because even though you claimed to remove all of them, you actually didn't.
124149619252_10152084246179253:I am restaurateur and it's an amazing company to work for. Sorry to everyone that have applied and not been hired. Keep applying you guys will get your shot next. Sometimes chipotle is not for everyone but if hired make the best out of it you'll learn a lot .
124149619252_379758315393214:They'll get enough $ to buy themselves burritos. Ill use the gift card money to buy me own burrito! CONGRATS NESTOR, YOU SOLVED YOUR HUNGER!
124149619252_10152453918534253:Don't be cheap with the chicken!  I've given you guys a long break and I'm not sure if I'll ever come back again.
124149619252_105860719543628:I can care less about the Grammy's but this might be the first time I watch it just to see the commercial!!!!
124149619252_194708182065:I have to second Duluth we have 90,000 people and 4 high schools and 3 colleges... plus you could probably make a profit off of me alone so it wouldn't be a bad decision
124149619252_10152250518069253:It's a huge bummer. Should honor it anyway. I have never tried there food...always wanted to. Perfect opportunity with this "coupon". However, probably will not ever go now.
124149619252_10153246130479253:This place sucks.....if you people think this food is authentic in anyway you are missing out on real Mexican food..... I'm sorry but this place is overrated, and should just close......
124149619252_10151486609219253:White rice, barbacooooooooa, fajitas, extra cheeeese, and sour cream! :) guac on the side! And those deeelicious chips ;)
124149619252_10153246130479253:So can we get more rice?!? I have to tell the employee to give me extra rice all the time!! ????????????????
124149619252_10152883474639253:They are so stingy with there food now and barely give you anything on a bowl and you still pay 7 bucks for it.
124149619252_10151089035244253:I love Chipotle, no matter where it is, but my very favorite is in Thornton, CO on 120th. Such good food and friendly staff! The Toledo, Ohio store was pretty wonderful, too.
124149619252_10151024826814253:bowl, brown rice, black beans, chicken x2, mild salsa, cheese and sour cream. tortilla on the side. BAM!!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:I like the Veggie Burrito BOwl: brown rice, black beans, lettuce, cheese, & a lil bit of each salsa. Oh & guacamole on top. YUM!!! :)
124149619252_105860719543628:I had the privilege of being an employee during my college career. I always loved and made others love and respect the fact that you're only real promoting was through your customers. However when the first radio ads started airing, I was impressed still. I can count on that the coming TVs ads will be funny, quirky, intelligent and everything Chipotle is!! I will love you forever. <3
124149619252_10151024826814253:"Started off with a spoonful of rice..black beans make it taste real nice..half barbacoa and the other half pollo..that's chicken in case you ain't know so, on to the pico hot salsa and corn..cheese, lettuce sour cream and joy is born..yeah I could've had a real bad day, til I opened up the fridge and saw the leftover Chipotle!" http://www.reverbnation.com/open_graph/song/13386575

124149619252_10153388589524253:Just work on getting the pork back :'( haven't been since I tried the tofu and it tasted like a spicy couch cushion
124149619252_190952584702:I was trying to think of what I wanted for lunch.And because i saw this posts it's gonna be chipotle.Good timing.

124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl with brown rice! Fajita and black beans, chicken, even though chipotle SKIMPS HARD on the meat, all the salsas, guacamole and lettuce. Note, you skimp hard on the meats! Step your game up chipotle!

124149619252_10150256700954253:For your birthday I'm going to give you $10.57 as your lil helper hands me a carnitas burrito and I slap some smoked chipotle tabasco sauce on there and SIP my Dr. Pepper while i read the wisdom on the side of the cup. What a good birthday it will be for both you and for me.
124149619252_10153212525009253:Oh my god I love chipotle, chipotles my life!!! Maria MacIntoshGracie WashburnKenny Von Wolfgang FrankensteinCody CampSpencer Eisner
124149619252_10152753260084253:Preparing food with gloves is yuck!  Why do I want rubber touching my food?  :P  just teasing you Michelle Williiams.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito with rice, pinto and black beans, chicken, mild and hot salsas, sour cream, cheese, a little lettuce and depending on my mood, guacamole!! Yummy!! :D
124149619252_10153528761379253:Why didn't festival organizers cancel one of the other bands or shorten their sets to make sure the headliner could play? Everyone knew it was supposed to storm at 5pm. My 6 year old, husband and I stood for 7 hrs to see WTM for his first concert,  only to have it canceled.  Total bummer:(
124149619252_10153543212484253:Just ate a Chipotle bowl hubby brought home. Yum. Cleaner ingredients! less worry than other taco places that use GMO corn, oils and guarantee meat loaded with chemicals, antibiotics & fed pesticides & GMO feed.
124149619252_10151024826814253:I have celiac disease so I get a yummy chicken bowl with just rice and beans.  Kudos to Chipotle for making it easier to eat out for celiacs!

124149619252_10153489055424253:Lexis Wiederholt we need number 16. P.S When the hell are we going again? I'm like a crack addict without her 8 ball. Lol.
124149619252_10153302468484253:Let's open Chipotle n the Conyers, Covington, Decatur, Lithonia, Stone Mountain area. That's Georgia baby.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I'm not questioning my "meathood". I'm questioning whether or not I want to choke down tofu JUST to get a meat burrito later for "free". Most signs are pointing towards "No".
124149619252_10153734396969253:I sure miss eating at Chipotle. I haven't eat there since the outbreak in the sickness because I don't want to get sick.
124149619252_205455487672:I drive 2 hours to worship in the house of chipotle, I gladly sacrifice my dollars for the tasty treats my heart desires! Lol
124149619252_379758315393214:Hypothetically speaking, if I were to buy myself a graduate gift card, AND I am not graduating from anything, could I also get a free burrito bowl before I started using my gift card at the following visit?
124149619252_10152250518069253:They did this a few years back, but haven't since so I was curious. Glad I came over here to look before going and looking a fool LOL
124149619252_10153706556384253:Better segregation of raw and cooked. More thoughtful training of staff on who can touch what (guess what? Wearing gloves does not = clean hands!) and ensuring hot food is actually hot and the meats are not just held at perfect incubation temperatures. your food is luke warm at best. That's a risk. PS: I am trained in food microbiology.
124149619252_10152805746454253:I go with blk beans, brown rice,hot salsa, guacamole,light lettuce. There burritos are huge and tasty fresh! :)
124149619252_10152004082504253:Not a joke... Just pure genius! I recall the very first time I saw it. It took me straight back to college, to my graphic design classes. My favorite Chipotle bag so far!
124149619252_10152560126959253:Burrito bowl inside the tortilla with white rice, double chicken, double steak, fajita veggies, corn salsa, alot of sour cream and cheese....my favorite
124149619252_10153009001449253:Went to the one on Bell Rd in Surprise AZ--- they "were out of Sofritas" by 5pm. Way to be prepared!!
124149619252_10153569576059253:chipotle... you're not gmo free if the animals you use for meat are raised eating gmo feed. let's be real
124149619252_10151024826814253:Crunchy tacos with white rice barbacoa medium (the green not the corn) cheese and lettuce. A side of chips and guacamole and a lemonade/sprite mix to drink.  
124149619252_196014333852317:Oh Joe....I still don't have the badge despite following and checking in 3X a week in Chicago.. :(  https://foursquare.com/v/chipotle-mexican-grill/4b085446f964a520340923e3
124149619252_10150298717314253:That's it. I hate being reminded of Chipotle when it's 50 minutes away. I'm gonna "unlike" now. Come to Melbourne damnit. 
124149619252_10151053134024253:In the middle of a CIA interrogation... Needless to say, I wouldn't and couldn't give them anything...
124149619252_160584150738666:Paris?? But I'm stuck in nowhere Oklahoma and have to drive three hours for one in OKC!! Couldn't you have come closer to me??? LOL
124149619252_10152822056649253:I startet to make my own bread a few years ago when i noticed problems while eating store bought. I came to the same discovery-the more water the better and I use to put a little home made sour cream in the mix, but the local flour was organic -no pesticides or artificial fertilizers and I think that was the most important diference. Would love to try this pizza!
124149619252_10153246130479253:So stupid I'm not gonna go to any restaurant that does this...I guess stay at home mom's can finally rejoice
124149619252_10152250518069253:Wow, so many people without a clue.  "What will one burrito cost them?"  Well people, do you really think that a coupon that can be printed as many times as wanted and that doesn't expire for 10 more days will be used by people only once?  Come on, are you really that dumb?  I'd imagine many of you blindly forward every stupid spam post that comes across your FB as gospel without ever checking it out.  Are you crying about Bill Gates for not honoring the Microsoft scam?  If you are dumb enough to not check out something like this with the company to see if it's legit before you go there you deserve to feel cheated, because you were.  Cheated out of a brain, that is.   Think people, if you have the ability.
124149619252_10152343053104253:I think that's pretty cool of you guys. Not only do people get to celebrate their religious holiday, but the people who don't celebrate it get the day off
124149619252_10153246130479253:Chipotle is not doing this for any reason other than to profit off of the current GMO paranoia. I will not eat here again.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Hooray for scientific illiteracy!  I'll be getting my burritos elsewhere from now on. It's fine that you want to make "healthy" food, but all this does is promote an already unsettling level of scientific illiteracy.
124149619252_10151486609219253:Burrito: White rice, Black beans, Carnitas, Pico & Corn Salsa, Lettuce, Cheese, Sour Cream. Perfection :)
124149619252_10151961054499253:Red, orange, yellow bell peppers could be in any location - we serve them when they're available, and generally that's in the late spring and summer months. - Joe
124149619252_10152323527922741:Im a grain farmer & chipotle is my favorite "fast food" restraunt.  Steak is a lil chewy tho... must be grass fed cows instead of that tasty corn fed beef!!!  Keep those burritos coming!!
124149619252_10153734396969253:Chipotle, you hang in there. You'll get it fixed. Find the saboteurs, either purposeful or unknowing. Change your employee health practices and food practices. I have faith in you.
124149619252_10150182464364253:I am 6'8 and I am a former employee of Chipotle. I will be wrapping myself...with some help...and then putting on my Chipotle shirt and hat. Get my prize winnings ready! tee hee

124149619252_135356053201187:I totally agree with you Karen Bailey. There are just oriole who complain for a living. Nothing will ever make them happy. Even if they get free food, nothing is ever right!
124149619252_10152323527922741:The stupid.... IT BURNS! Seriously though, what the deuce is this tripe? Good job strengthening the already abysmal public ignorance of agriculture, Chipotle!
124149619252_10153232136249253:Take your time and keep your high standards. That is why I love Chipotle so much.   On the "don't eat meat" rants people are making, we are human animals. We are supposed to eat meat. That is how we evolved. If you don't want to eat meat, great. But your vegetarian views should be just like your religious views, kept to yourself.
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken burrito , white rice, no beans, dash of hot sauce, dash of sour cream, and EXTRA EXTRA CHEESE
124149619252_10152408378957741:Jeff Krause, you can ask them to double the tortilla when they start making it to keep that from happening. :)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Crispy carnitas tacos, sometimes with a little white rice. Sour cream, cheese, lettuce and corn salsa on the side so I can avoid the jalepenos (I'm a wimp). Can't ever get enough!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Fajita Burrito w/extra rice, barbacoa, mild and medium salsa, lots of sour cream and just a pinch of cheese. YUM.
124149619252_160584150738666:And, even better, next Thursday we get a burrito bowl in Burlington, Vermont!! Laissez les bons temps rouler!
124149619252_10151024826814253:steak fajita bowl, extra rice no beans extra peppers all salsa little sour cream lots of cheese guac, and yes, i do know that guacamole is extra
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thousands of studies have shown that the available genetically engineered foods on the market are no more harmful to human health than their non-GE counterparts and in fact have benefits for both human health and the environment. Companies like Chipotle are simply doing this for marketing reasons, not scientific ones.
124149619252_10152883478794253:Glad i live in San Diego... who needs this crappy company when we have so many BETTER places to eat, and the others are cop friendly.
124149619252_122372141178171:you dont have to "have it all" at Chipotle, no tortilla, guacamole or sour  c would lower the calories!!
124149619252_100780796665922:Same as others...I went to Qdoba and thought "what a terrible imitation of Chipotle"...Chipotle ALL DAY!
124149619252_10152323527922741:Cindy Vaughn Barnes people can deny that fact all they want, but you're exactly right whether anyone likes it or not
124149619252_10152177306959253:I cannot look at him without thinking he is the devil (reaper). I was scrolling down my news feed quickly and this pic went past and I thought "what's the devil doing". hahahahaha
124149619252_10152560126959253:Bowl with LITE AMOUNTS OF MEAT (chicken or steak) due to the fact that Chipotle now uses flat plancha style grills instead of the serratred ones they used to use...Chipotle really took a STEP BACK with this change as far as healthy food and taste...health because the flat palancha grills cook the meat in is own saturated fat and nearly blacken the meat which leaves more carcinogens
124149619252_279121798773401:I appreciate it!! This gluten free girl appreciates knowing where my food comes from! Way to go Chipotle!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Represent Perimeter Loop in Dublin, Ohio!! That is my Chipotle and we are making it the best in town :)
124149619252_185864848093833:Not true about farms not needing antibiotics.  Even the best cared for children sometimes require antibiotics, same with animals.
124149619252_10152927494854253:Chipotle Burritos are so big, they are like the size of a newborn baby.  but it looks really weird if you try to hold the burritos it in your arms like a baby!!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thank you Chipotle, for having the only fast food worth eating!  We've been eating with you since 2001.  Our family enjoyed every minute of the Cultivate Festival in Las Colinas, and we're glad even Food Inc. endorsed your sustainable produce and antibiotic free meats.  Keep up the good work--and let other establishments take heed:  fresh food is the BEST FOOD! ????
124149619252_10152990683604253:Tacos are good but you don't get the same amount of food. I like to save half of my burrito for dinner
124149619252_10152250518069253:ya, I drove all the way there too figure that out. Should have gave me a free burrito for driving all they there. lol
124149619252_10151089035244253:Any location is my favorite, we have a 40 min drive to the closest Chipolte to our home, and it use to be a 4 block walk. WHAAAAA.
124149619252_10150256700954253:18 years old?  Wow, old enough to start having kids soon.  Looks like you're going to need some changing tables.  (hint, hint)
124149619252_10153009001449253:I thought it was pretty good but still prefer veggie burrito with quacamole. The sofritas had good flavor but a little too salty. It was nice to have this opportunity to try it!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito, both kinds of rice, chicken or steak, a little corn, a little cheese and lettuce. Get medium salsa on the side to add just a bit to some bites.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Fajita burrito white rice, fajita veggies, steak meat, mild salsa, cheese, corn, extra sour cream, with a side of guac yummmmmmmo
124149619252_10153389325099253:We are trying it tonight for the first time.  I don't know alot about Chipotle.  Any suggestions? What is good?
124149619252_209217239092800:No offense to Steve Ells, but he wasn't wearing gloves when he was working the line !!!!! Thats a big no no at Chipotle. We were paying attention to ya.
124149619252_10151486609219253:White rice, pinto beans, peppers and onions are a must. It varies between chicken and barbacoa cuz theyre both AMAZING, always hot salsa, corn, sour cream and cheese!
124149619252_10151024826814253:My fevt veggie bowl with brown rice ,black beans,cheese ,lettuce ,corn ,spicy salsa ,sour cream, guacamole !!! Dats Sooooo yameeeee

124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa bowl with extra meat, extra extra rice, extra extra tomato, extra medium salsa and some cheese . . . it's like 2 meals, so awesome. Oh and I eat it with chips instead of a fork . . . best . . . salsa . . . ever . . .
124149619252_10151908068909253:Redate Ali - it's for charity. They don't have to do anything special for us or anyone at all. Get some perspective and show some love to the burrito people, they rock!
124149619252_10153246130479253:I love your transparency! You're going to see that your honesty is going to make Chipotle even more successful! ????
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito: brown rice, peppers and onions, black beans, regular and medium salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce. NOM!
124149619252_10152560126959253:I love chipotle, it's nice to eat somewhere where I can make my meal dairy free since I have dairy allergies but anyways mine is a veggie burrito or bowl with the chipotle vinegarette sauce in the side
124149619252_10151024826814253:Grilled chicken burrito bowl with white rice, black beans, corn, mild salsa lettuce and a nice cold blackberry soda.
124149619252_492523374093310:Dude I started eating chipotle when they first opened in like 2003 or something in Lee`s Summit  MO but it wasn`t until I moved to Columbus, Ohio and lived 1 block behind it where I started eating it like crazy from the end of 2003 then I gained hella weight and then I moved to Canada in Dec 2009 and was coming back and forth until I got my permanent residence and everytime I come to visit fam in atl ga I eat chipotle but the sucky thing about atl the chipotles are all so far apart because the city and surrounding areas are so far away , if they had point cards I probably would be rich already lol
124149619252_10151058843154253:WOAHHH!! I was JUST there in Gurnee this past weekend from ohio! I didnt notice that windmill! :/ Nor did I know i was in a restaurant with "first" history lol
124149619252_10153310575624253:Just attend in Phoenix,  definately reccomended the visit, we loaded up our kids their chilled snacks and waters in wagons and had a blast!
124149619252_10150959152619253:Please please come to myrtle beach SC you are missing the boat you are in nc and Charleston SC why not use?........
124149619252_185864848093833:Organic has nothing to do with calories. People that are saying its so healthy need to realize its not HEALTHY when theres over 1000 calories in a burrito. Veggie fed beef, what are people talking about? What do cows eat thats not a grass or a vegetable. Where is the study that says animals raised in pens are different than free range? what the hell does free range mean to people? All animals are in some sort of a pen. Its not the wild west. Why would farmers/ranchers spend so much extra money for anti biotics, like charlie said, they are expensive!
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito Bowl white rice, extra black brans, chicken, hot salsa,sour dream, extra corn, chesse,lettuce
124149619252_240071849428248:Charles, if they were to give everyone free guac, even on one day, do you know how much that would cost the company?  Be reasonable.  It's a contest... that means not everyone wins.  And that's ok.  I, personally, love Chipotle and Foursquare, so I intend on playing.  If I lose, so be it.  I'll still eat there.
124149619252_10152927494854253:I could eat a steak burrito bowl for dinner every day (if I could afford that).   Ahhh...someday I will be able!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl with brown rice, a little black bean, fajita veggies, chicken, a little mild, medium salsa on the side, cheese and lettuce. I get it every time. 
124149619252_10153844182544253:have you cleaned your restaurants?  Every Chipotle Mexican Grill I go to is just plain filthy in the seating area.  25 people behind the counter but I have to ask for a fork for my bowl, lid for my drink, and a napkin.  I've been a huge supporter but it's almost sickening when I go in to one to see the floors and tables covered with other people's leftovers.  I love your concept your food is good, but your restaurant is gross.
124149619252_10152883486474253:Nothing feels Mexican about that place. They outta go to Mexico and get a real taste for the food there.
124149619252_10153236016399253:Say what! Kindra Joy does this mean we can have a lazy day and have chipotle delivered to us?! Woo hoo!
124149619252_10152949800154253:People that say they will never eat there will be the first on the line lmao I LOVE CHIPOTLE u can't beat natural raised and organic  now if u wanna be cheap go to taco hell lol
124149619252_10152250518069253:There is such thing as a free lunch. I've gotten many free things from Chipotle Mexican Grill including a burrito today
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Bowl, white rice, chicken, tomatoes, sour cream, cheese & chips and guac.. coke zero haha yum
124149619252_10153872104594253:Someone  needs to grab a marker and write on it --- E Coli!!!!!  I lost SOOOOO much lb after eating my last burrito. No more and I miss it!
124149619252_10153246130479253:All food is genetically modified...   Selective breeding is genetic modification and is far worse to an organism than transgenic manipulation or RNA interference.
124149619252_10151551513714253:Chipotle Mexican Grill - No, that's when the next logical time would be. Trying to help you guys plan out when and where to go.
124149619252_379758315393214:I would die for you chipotle..  even though i just had 1 and 2 earlier..  u complete me.  Marry me??  Be my valentine??
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl with black beans (ask to drain the juice off), steak - extra meat, light on the pico, corn, cheese and lettuce with guac on the side and a diet coke :) 
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito with white rice, black beans, chicken, tomato salsa, wee bit of sour cream and cheese, guacamole for the surcharge, and lettuce.
124149619252_10151089035244253:Sunrise - Citrus Heights CA!  My first Chipotle experience - consistently good food, speedy service and great attitudes!
124149619252_10152805746454253:I think Staten Island needs a Chipotle! Everytime I go to NJ, or the city, chipotle is my first stop! But I will take a carnitas boorito
124149619252_193346814021706:Why do people still think McDonald's owns Chipotle?  And why would anyone think Qdobo is better?  So wrong.
124149619252_10152250518069253:But grossly overcharging  for some guacamole is fine? Nice Joe. I'm sure a free burrito is going to put you folks at Chipotle in a real bind. It's not like you didn't give free burritos away for Halloween before.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Since Chipotle is avoiding fake dangers, I'd also like some reassurance that a magical elf named Murray hasn't spit in my burrito next time I go there.
124149619252_10152883478794253:We're sorry this happened and this is not something we support. This might explain it a lttle better: http://chip.tl/NYPDStatement -Skyllo
124149619252_10153009001449253:Was so looking forward to this all day and when I called the nearest CT restaurant to me they said they were already closed at 4:30 p.m. so I couldn't take advantage of it after I left work at 5 p.m. I totally understand that there's a blizzard coming at night, but there were other restaurants still open for dinner after 6 p.m.
124149619252_10151089035244253:Paris! And we Americans love that you have an ice bucket by the register for the drinks. Makes an expat smile :)
124149619252_10151058843154253:Much more appealing architecture and design. I could never understand the use of "Rusting steel" as an architectural feature and how it stains everything around it....
124149619252_10151089035244253:I would love to say Madison Ohio(Lake county)...but there isn't one so I guess  Mentor Ohio mentor Ave
124149619252_199537401806:Connecticut! New London area near the Naval base! Right now we have to drive to Rhode Island to eat Chipotle!  :-(
124149619252_10153792851004253:Never been there since the E. Coli scare. Used to eat there 1-2x per week. Some of their  workers  would be less generous with the servings....Well they can't drag me back in there until this mess is cleared. ..Yes you can get sick with any other restaurants but I didn't want to buy the E. Coli that comes with the food.
124149619252_228034027252006:Ahh, the rage of the entitled masses over a 2 dollar donation...  At least my horsehead mask will come in handy
124149619252_157777224183:Now that you're saving all that money on power, you can lower the price of your guacamole.  Fantastic!
124149619252_10151687038594253:yeah the same thing happened to me too. i tried to put in the correct answer every way but it still won't go.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Burrito Bowl with Black Beans, White Rice, Extra Chicken, Xtra Salsa, Lots of Lettuce, Sour Cream, Corn, Pepper & Onions + Tobasco Pepper Sauce + Guacamole = YUMMILICIOUS !
124149619252_10152925087634253:A location in Lebanon county PA would be awesome. Hershey PA has the closest one to me and it's a 40 minute drive from my house. And a lot of people I know still already make the commute.
124149619252_10151626575004253:Hooman, Darren, too bad they dont show their workers that. Today i got a brick burrito instead of a rolled one -_-
124149619252_10153389325099253:At work where I never will fit in and find my true passion for the burritos that I truly desire. I must become a burrito. It is my one and only goal. #burritoman2015 @ChipotleSnaps
124149619252_115365598544868:Oh, silly, CarolAnn deleted her comment. D'oh!  Marilyn, Alan's comment is gone now. I guess enough people, including me, reported him. Thanks, Chipotle FB mods! :)
124149619252_10151719407409253:One of the answers has the same word used twice in it. The drop down menu has two separate instances of that word. For that answer, be sure to use BOTH of them, not one of them twice.  That solves the issue.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl - jasmine rice, barbecoa, JUICE ONLY from the regular salsa (for moisture sake), a little bit of sour cream and a little bit of cheese - BAM!!!
124149619252_10152949800154253:Dear chipotle, i went to the chipotle in chicago ridge, il & didnt get to order anything because they were out of steak & chicken. I walked away so did a lot of other customers. #tragedy
124149619252_193346814021706:Tell those in charge that they REALLY need to find a way to put a restaurant in Hyde Park, NY or Poughkeepsie, close to the CIA - especially since your founder graduated from there! My son is a student there now and he and his buddies crave Chipotle SOO much. That's the first place we go whenever he comes home and last place we take him just before boarding his plane back to school. The closest one for them is about 65 miles away I believe. LOL
124149619252_10153009001449253:Yep. They ran out at my store too. It was before the dinner rush too. They didn't offer a rain check or apologize for anything
124149619252_100780796665922:Thank you for such a yummy dinner last night Chipotle!  I have to refrain from going back there today!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Vegetarian burrito or burrito bowl (depending on my mood): Black beans, brown rice, fajita vegetables, tomato salsa, corn salsa, and extra guacamole :D
124149619252_10151089035244253:We've been to Chipotle in a few different states and the location in Bountiful, Utah is by far the best!  Friendliest employees and the freshest food!
124149619252_10152632602189253:Lmao I know, and getting a burrito tat is tacky as well. For my next birthday I am expecting a chipotle burrito cake Amenah ??
124149619252_179271002091714:Follow me on twitter!!! Moment4life1 Follow me on twitter!!! Moment4life1 Follow me on twitter!!! Moment4life1
124149619252_10152250518069253:I love how everyone is freaking out that chipotle never does free. I've gotten free burrito coupons from my location a few times. Just for existing. I haven't seen many other companies do that.
124149619252_10153246130479253:OMG!  GMO?  all I care about is how you guys keep trying to cheat me out of some meat every time I go...why do I have to keep begging for more meat?!?!  I don't care if it's got GMO or MSG or CBS just keep me happy by giving me more meat, that's good customer service...this whole GMO thing is about trying to capitalize on a stupid trend...why not advertise that your beans are gluten-free?  ALL BEANS ARE GLUTEN-FREE!!!  I won't be going to Chipopottle anymore...
124149619252_182076481805338:I had a bad dream last night that Chipotle was posting stuff about killing cats.  Today I just want to focus on the fact that their sour cream is so fresh and delicious, I could drink it.

124149619252_10152407734029253:Way to piss off the middle class. Ya know the people I'm talking about, the people that can afford to eat at your establishments
124149619252_10151658877254253:I applaud Chipotle for disclosure and hope the other chains follow - being a leader out there on this is taking a big step and they were the first ones so BRAVO Chipotle!!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito bowl!!! brown rice, black beans, BARBACOA, sour cream, hot and mild sauce, cheese, and the best part... GUACAMOLEEEEE!
124149619252_10151149863494253:Dear Chipotle.... i Love you... could eat you everyday... but One favor to ask... Please, Please.. PLEASE!!!! chill out on the cilantro... its the most disgusting thing ever created and so time consuming to pick every single piece out of my bowl every time Im there..... "sigh" you should use it as a SEPERATE topping like everything else so if people want cilantro they can choose it, but for those of us with taste buds... we won't have to suffer the wrath!!
124149619252_10153150981964253:The lady in my area sucks  I don't over stuff the the burrito she always try to strangle it when she wraps is and always rips it
124149619252_10151024826814253:CARNITAS. Must have guac and sour cream. RIP chorizo; I still haven't forgotten you during those glorious test days in the NYC stores.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl with brown rice, black beans, steak, fresh salsa, lettuce and cheese...chips on the side.  It is great diet food if you skip the sour cream and only eat half of the burrito bowl and chips in one setting (save the other half for later...yum!).  The sour cream is like crack...very addicting...so, skip it if you are trying to lose weight! :D
124149619252_10151839071994253:I'd do all the German translation you require for free...or maybe for a free burrito :D I missed you so much!!! Every time I'm back in the states, I try to eat at your place as many times as possible haha
124149619252_10151892810414253:You seem to have left my name off the list.  I accept your mistake, and look forward to you sending me an email regarding my 20 years of free burritos.  Thanks.
124149619252_10153001213604253:Thank you for setting a precedent and for caring about animals!! You have just gained a new customer :) very impressed.
124149619252_10152715839394253:OMG!!!! Why do you guys only have breakfast at IAD airport???  I need it all day, every day.  Chipotle, that is!
124149619252_10153240834269253:Going to get a burrito today thanks to your stand against GMO's and your COURAGE to label ALL your products as GMO free.  I will now only eat exclusively at Chipotle.  Thank you! Thank you!  Thank you!!!

124149619252_10152992584389253:Twice I have wasted time going there to see no carnitas.  Will you guys let us know when you actually decide to sell it again so some of us dont waste our time?
124149619252_199537401806:Laramie, Wyoming!!!! Im from Colorado and I had Chipotle like every other week. I came up to Laramie for school and to go from every other week to when ever I can go home now, it KILLS ME!!! Half the students here are from Colorado too, so they are missing Chipotle too. So PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring a CHIPOTLE here. I will be your first customer and your first employee.
124149619252_10151486609219253:Stopped getting the burritos.  Tacos are a much better experience - steak, cheese, sour cream, medium/tomatillo and hot salsa, romaine.  Beans and rice ftL.
124149619252_10153656854824253:Lets be real. That's a film set. I've never seen a Chipotle anywhere near that clean, neat, and pristine.
124149619252_10151486609219253:I always get a veggie bowl with lots of black beans and brown rice, pico de gallo, cheese, veges, and guac!  And corn tortias!  I get it every week as often as I can!  Love Chipolte!!!
124149619252_130916887010628:It should be if you dress up in any costume you get the burrito for $2...but if u wear a costume inspired by the family farm then you get a free drink or free chips n salsa...im pretty sure if they did that...sales would be higher...
124149619252_10153246130479253:But is Chipotle even really concerned about seed breeding techniques or even pesticide traits that are involved with some GMOs? As part of their switch they changed from using soybean oil to sunflower oil.[3] When asked about the type of sunflowers now being used on Twitter they responded that, Our sunflowers have an herbicide-tolerant trait as a result of natural cross-breeding, not genetic manipulation.[4]  Herbicide tolerant sunflowers are a product of BASF.[5] These sunflowers were bred to be resistant to BASFs Beyond, an imazamox based herbicide. When compared to Roundup, Beyond appears to be more toxic to bees, less biodegradable,[6] and as an ALS inhibitor appears to be more prone to the development of resistant weeds.[7] The sunflowers are also no more natural than the genetically modified soybeans that they have replaced.  BASF used a process known as mutagenesis to breed their sunflowers. Their seeds were doused with ethyl methanesulfonate and sodium azide to alter their DNA.[8] Ethyl mathanesulfonate is a possibly carcinogenic compound that produces random mutations in DNA.[9] Sodim azide is an extremely toxic compound used as a biocide and in airbag systems. It is lethal to humans at only 0.7 grams.[10] The Beyond sunflowers even require tillage or the use of glyphosate anyways.[11] A direct apples to apples comparison is kind of difficult though to be fair. Comparing glyphosate resistant soybeans with imazamox tolerant sunflowers would probably require years of research to evaluate environmental and health differences. The one conclusion that we can draw is that Chipotle is not doing this for any reason other than to profit off of the current GMO paranoia.  http://welovegv.com/entries/gmos/chipotle
124149619252_10153780999604253:A "Typhoid Outbreak" has happened to Qdoba before.  This situation is not unique to Chipotle. What is unique is the coordinated corporate effort to bring down Chipotle and brain wash the public.  https://foodpoisoningbulletin.com/2015/typhoid-outbreak-at-qdoba-restaurant-in-firestone-co/
124149619252_10151486609219253:Barbocoa, white rice, black beans, hot suace, extra hot sauce, sour cream, corn salsa and guacamole...  Yummy!!!
124149619252_10151486609219253:Vegetarian with brown rice, black beans, salsa, guacamole, sour cream, cheese and lettuce! Should probably cut out the sour cream, but I won't. Oh, and I use a lot of the chipotle hot sauce. Yum!
124149619252_10152022699034253:Well doing a google search of Issys Milky Way across from it I was able to find out that it is at Camden Passage London England.
124149619252_10152786808474253:Always packed at every location here in Columbus! I wish the prices had not went up so much though....don't go as much now. Instead of 4 or 5 times a month it is now just once or twice!
124149619252_10152250518069253:You're welcome Shakena Beasley. I had to check bc I love some free food girl lol. The best kind. Didn't want to go & look crazy though
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa burrito, original cilantro rice, lots of cheese and sour cream, mild and medium salsa, jalapeno tabasco & black beans!

124149619252_10152773616059253:It's sad that there needs to be a law to force food manufacturers to properly inform consumers of their ingredients. Should be a given
124149619252_228034027252006:Are people REALLY complaining about making a $2 donation to a good cause and getting a burrito out of the deal as well?  C'mon, quit being such pinches grinches!  jejejeje
124149619252_10153246130479253:That's a "good start".... Now please STOP pilling up them unhealthy amount of Salt would be better... The sodium level on each Burrito is insanely High!
124149619252_228034027252006:They are not taking away your free burrito.  You were never entitled to a free burrito.  They had an awesome promotion for their restaurants and they have since changed it.  Businesses change their promotions all the time.  Yeah it's not as cool and easy as it was before, but it's still a great deal and it's for a good cause.  Most restaurants don't do anything at all.  Even though my costume won't work for the promotion this year I still think Chipotle is awesome for doing this.
124149619252_130916887010628:Just a question-are the proceeds staying here in the USA to help our own? $2.00 is a very inexpensive burrito. Thanks Chipotle. Just wish there was 1 near by.
124149619252_10153009001449253:My location ran out however they didn't ring it as a Sofritas, so hoping my location will still honor the promotion... but I really wanted to try the tofu!
124149619252_10152104828699253:Fellow Chipotle addicts and Farm Team fans, check out our Chipotle Farm Team Fanatics group on Facebook  :)
124149619252_10152560126959253:Chicken Fajita Burrito bowl, no beans, white rice, corn, green, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce. Mmmmmmm.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Chipotle Mexican Grill what about those of us vegetarians that are snowed in from Blizzard Juno and can't make it?! :(
124149619252_454413931302356:Private groups can still discriminate. Think about the KKK. The BSA's policy discourages homosexual scouts and leaders from being who they are. It encourages heterosexual scouts to view and treat homosexual people in a discriminatory and derogatory manner.  You're certainly welcome to boycott Chipotle. That's your right. But complaining about them not financially supporting a group with views they disagree with is rather silly.
124149619252_199537401806:I won dinner for 4 by leaving my business card in the pot !! I'm to call in my order for Thursday!! Yay!!

124149619252_10151267410249253:You must have been tricked into thinking you had Chipotle, Shafee.  Because Chipotle has never lead me or my rear-end astray!  Correct, Nicole Tucker
124149619252_10151185000424253:OMG people, get over it! They are not free anymore, only one night a year we get $2 burritos, bowls or tacos (guac included) it's their biggest fundraiser of the year! So, let's do it!!! :)
124149619252_182078509223:hey i work at the store in boca raton fl.... i just wanna know wen u gona start doing deliveries????????? cuz we are really busy
124149619252_100780796665922:Qdoba has terrible customer service.  Chipotle all the way.  There is a reason why the Qdoba in Duarte California is always slow.   Now if we can get a Chipotle in Monrovia California that would be the best.
124149619252_10153246130479253:So will you stop selling soda?  Is your cheese going to be produced with natural rennet (watch out baby cows)? Where you will buy your corn from? Over 98% of corn grown in the US is GMO.. Must be Mexican family farms?
124149619252_164816057005566:Super tasty yay!  I hope this sticks around as I'm so happy to have something more than just pepers and onions to add to my veggie bowl.  Got to try it at your San Jose Union location.
124149619252_10152250518069253:I would think that if the "coupon" has been shared enough to publicly address; maybe it would be a good idea to piggyback on it. Unbias opinion, I've never eaten  at Chipotle.
124149619252_10152560126959253:"The Kids Menu chicken quesadilla with chocolate milk A kid, hopefully, or at least young enough-looking to get carded when attempting to buy cigarillos from gas stations."  DOES CHIPOTLE CONDONE CHILDREN SMOKING?
124149619252_520689341285681:We've got hungry vegans in Vegas too!  Great to see you jumping on board by offering more compassionate choices to us plant-eaters!  :)
124149619252_156053474470:Heck yeah!!! I would order chipotle every day if they delivered it to my house!!! But I think it would be a good idea for them to come up with come up with some new side dishes too. 
124149619252_10153246130479253:Makes me love Chipotle even more! This shows Chipotle supports my future health and the future health of our planet ???? Great job, guys!
124149619252_10151486609219253:These are what in my burrito! Food with integrity??!?!? http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/03/27/blogger-foodbabe-win-chipotle-ingredients
124149619252_10153246130479253:It only justifies charging $12 for a burrito and small drink. I'll go to moe's and get the same thing for cheaper.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak, white rice, pinto beans, red salsa, corn, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, double wrapped
124149619252_10151626575004253:Its the easiest thing ever! It just disturbs me when people get mad if some people are bad burrito rollers. I wanna see you trying to roll a burrito with extra sour cream, extra cheese, extra meat, corn, everything! Then we will see if your able to roll it.
124149619252_10153200118729253:My first date with my fiance was at a Chipotle.  It was great! We actually go there for our anniversaries.
124149619252_10152084246179253:Yes, I have. I applied several times to several locations near me, had 3 interviews while eating and 2 formal interviews but was not hired.
124149619252_10151973813714253:Had a family boorito night before trick-or-treating :) We had a GREAT time seeing everyone out in their costumes, having fun, and eating some VERY delicious "food with integrity." Thank you, Chipotle Mexican Grill!!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Alyssia Morenothansk for this tag! looks liek i will be having chipotle in Washington next week two days in a row! lol
124149619252_10151089035244253:Mine was Lenexa.... Until today. My beans in my bowl weren't even luke-warm. Yuck!! Disappointed by Chipotle today!!! Straight out of a can cold:(
124149619252_10151024826814253:I always get a steak burrito without any beans, but loaded with lots of extra rice. I also get the veggies (YUM!), sour cream, cheese, and lettuce. MY FAVE!!!
124149619252_10153602183249253:Thats really good photoshop. They use the same style and typeface. That Chipotle used in all there ads. That means a copyright infringement took place as well. What supposed magazine was this in? Pr backfire?
124149619252_10152407734029253:I will no longer eat at Chipotle Mexican Grill and I will tell my friends to do the same.  As long as they allow open carry I will not eat any of their restaurants.
124149619252_194708182065:Joint base mcguire/dix/lakhurst!!! We hate driving forever to get so chipotle!!! Military pays good and makes the best customers!! 
124149619252_162705813797304:If chipotle is so healthy shouldn't it be white meat for the chicken? Instead of dark? Also it could br done with less oil.. Im just saying..
124149619252_10151486609219253:Double wrapped, Extra rice, Black beans, Carnitas and/or Barbacoa, Mild, Corn, Sour cream and Cheese. Chipotle Tabasco or Hot on the side. Verde of I feel like mixing it up lol
124149619252_10151024826814253:Stake burrito Bowl with a lettuce bed, then white rice black beans some fajitas maybe, steak of course then my extra cheese hot salsa easy corn and sourcream And last but not least some guacamole!! Just perfectO!! ;-)
124149619252_10152864893019253:There's actually a technique where you don't need to use the foil at all... came up with it myself :)
124149619252_10152307671269253:Chipotle, I love your food and that you are sustainable and all, but please get with the program and put changing stations in your bathrooms.  On more than one occasion and at more than one Chipotle location I have been left seriously hanging.  Please and thank you.  -chipotle loving mama
124149619252_10152250518069253:It shouldn't be a hoax, with as much as Chipotle prides themselves on certain things...you'd think you would be a bit more willing to give customers a break every now and then.
124149619252_10151089035244253:Dayton Ohio on brown St is the best always there they help you so much and always asking do the Food be good. And they are so professional!!! Gotta love em
124149619252_10152724330769253:We need a Chipotle in Downtown Long Beach!!! (several places available at The Pike in Long Beach) ????????
124149619252_10153001213604253:Chipotle in lawrenceburg in NOT GOOD - ran out of items on opening day Thursday and closed now due to running out of food !!!!!!!
124149619252_10152736236459253:and what if we really do have that problem and it's not just something we "think" we do..lol. I do love Chipotle bags though. :) ~~ entertainment in a bag
124149619252_10153555173409253:I think about it @ least once a month! Chipotle until we meet again in 2016: I miss U!!! Shola Imhome Harris
124149619252_10152949800154253:Thenall, I'm sorry they were out of steak and chicken. It sounds like there may have been something wrong with their grill, but we'll look into this. We'll also make sure they are communicating these issues better to their guests. -Skyllo
124149619252_10151611917404253:I never give up hope that we will get a Chipotle here in Northfield MN.  Love love love the barbacoa.
124149619252_192398874125268:for those that can't open it...its because you're using Internet Explorer....try using Mozilla and it will work :)
124149619252_10152786808474253:Chipotle needs to sell ULIVjava! it would go fantastic in your restaurants, I just tried it and its the only thing you are lacking!!
124149619252_10150300340834253:this is a new way of hiring people. . But i guess its a good way. . I would turn my resume in , but im 3100 miles from DC . . I hope u know i will be late for work lol
124149619252_10153246130479253:It's disappointing that Chipotle would contribute to the widespread misunderstanding and misinformation about safe GMO foods like this.
124149619252_105860719543628:WA WA WA WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!~~~~~~~~
124149619252_10153246130479253:Hey Chiptole, thanks for removing the GMOs! However, I wanted to ask if you could improve the quality of your foil. Unfortunately I've found that it's not nearly as effective at preventing alien mind-control as other leading aluminum foils. Your brave stand against GMOs makes me confident you're aware of the dangers of alien mind-manipulation as well, so I hope you're working to rectify this ASAP.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thank you for doing this! I know you've taken some heat, but I really appreciate having a restaurant to support that is not using GMOs.
124149619252_10152018242589253:I remember when they used to close early. At least the one in Downtown Denver did. They used to close at around 4:00 if I remember correctly.
124149619252_10151258924194253:So happy your employees get the day off to enjoy themselves and their families!!! One more reason I love you.
124149619252_454413931302356:Because Chipolte is Discriminating the Boy Scouts and bullying them, I will never spend a dime there again..
124149619252_10152883478794253:You can forget about trying to fix it now. If you need to think about it twice, your moral compass is too far broken to be redeemed on second thought. There are way too many better places deserving of my money.
124149619252_10153395310879253:Haven't lost until it's all over and as far as I know it's not over yet... Wouldn't want to be in your shoes when it is though.
124149619252_10152236327209253:Lucky New York and New England. When can we have it in Columbus, OH? -- signed Devoted Vegan Customer Who's Impatiently Waiting
124149619252_10153389325099253:Stewart Craft I shouldn't have liked this chipotle page bc now I always see pics of it and want it so bad...
124149619252_10153246130479253:I will no longer eat at your restaurant. Giving in to people who disregard a clear understanding of scientific data confirming the safety of GMOs makes you a part of the problem.
124149619252_199537401806:I love Chipotle but wish I didn't have to drive so far from my house to get it.  Please come to Johnstown Ohio we need one here.
124149619252_341532579201452:I love Chipotle but I get so annoyed at the lines people because I go there often and I have to explain EVERY SINGLE TIME that I would like a burrito bowl with small portions for my sons kids meal, he doesn't eat the taco shells so I have them just put the chicken in a bowl. Why is that so hard to comprehend! And I wish they could prepare steak well done for people like me who don't like under cooked steak! 
124149619252_10153246130479253:Terrible news.  Sorry to hear you guys are bending to a niche crowd that probably doesn't even eat at your restaurants.
124149619252_10151892810414253:Have spent a few hours trying and getting nowhere with the Farm Team stuff and just decided to give up a while ago.  Lots of headaches for nothing.
124149619252_134085872963:That was cute and good!  and it helps that hes a total hottie.  id like to see all you haters come up with something better
124149619252_10153009001449253:Does this apply to online orders? And if I order two items with sofritas can I get two free burritos the next time I go?!
124149619252_10152322736529253:I just had Chipotle tonight.  Delicious.  I felt like I was gypped on my portion though, normally they give a lot more, especially when I paid more for guac.
124149619252_10153806089609253:Huge portions, a big pile of fat and non-fiber carbohydrates, and extremely poor sanitation. Trust pseudo-science and abusive marketing practices and this is what you get. Keep eating this garbage!
124149619252_10152753077074253:Heather, can you please write to us here: http://chip.tl/re0OLp and tell us what your child is ordering? That way we can explain the pricing. -Skyllo
124149619252_10151024826814253:You guys should have one monthly new topping, just one new thing for one month then switch then switch etc...
124149619252_10150182464364253:Wow! What I love is a building that happens to be about 150,000 tons of milled and handcarved limestone. Unfortunately, there isn't enough time in the rest of my life to wrap it in foil, nor could I afford that much foil. The $10k prize wouldn't cover it. It has seven football fields of roof area. Help!
124149619252_205082546217004:i agree with you brad... a lot of people dont look at the calories in jimmy johns sandwiches, if someone knew that one sandwich was anywhere from 700-900 calories, they may think twice about ordering it every day for lunch! and thats the only one on here i actually know about...
124149619252_10153009001449253:Pointless. I would only throw the sofritas burrito away because it's nasty. And just buy it to get the free burrito. So it's pointless
124149619252_10152236327209253:How are you going to make sure it doesn't cross-contaminate with other food items? Soy's a big allergen.
124149619252_10152261058584253:Shawn Walsh, Michael Huang Trinidad, Wynn Pham, Wesley Zhao Trinidad Raymond Wu Trinidad let's go to Austin, TX. right now!  Not sure if they'll do this for Philadelphia, but I'll cross my fingers!
124149619252_10152250518069253:I knew from the second I saw it, that it was fake. The graphic design was not up to Chipotle standards and didnt have the chipotle feel to it.
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken-steak burrito bowl with white rice, black beans, peppers, hot & mild salsa, corn, sour cream, cheese and guacamole  this is the best one ever!!!!!!!!!
124149619252_10151089035244253:My first job. Chipotle Store 101 AKA PrestonRidge, in Plano, TX. Great good, good people, and I learned a ton about working hard and striving to do better.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Double-wrapped steak fajita burrito with white rice, pico, lettuce, and extra cheese.  Chips optional.
124149619252_156053474470:I would order no less than 1 time every week. Deliver the beer and izzy too?  Make that 3 times a week. Bring it to Houston next!
124149619252_10153872104594253:I love Chipotle, I eat there at least twice a week if not more. Even when they said it was an outbreak... Not in my Charlotte one lol..
124149619252_10152693491999253:Chipotle Mexican Grill IS what the food industry should be about, especially fast food. They aren't like your typical company/ corporation. They are for organic, natural, locally grown farms. They are for REAL food without the chemicals, pereservatives, additives, empty calories, GMO's, and pesticides.  They hate industrial meat farming. They are in it to spread awareness against people like Monsanto. They believe in humanely raising pigs, cows, and chickens without cages, steroids, growth hormones, and antibiotics. They aren't cruel to them either. They let them live as freely as possible. They aren't in the business for the money, but for the love of what they believe in. I mean, if they were, they would get low quality fillers and mass produce. They wouldn't home make their food or have fresh, wholesome ingredients, or present the integrity they do. They promote solar lighting for the environment and they help the economy by supporting your local folk's farmers market!
124149619252_10153215460149253:Really, really enjoyed Cultivate in Dallas area last year.  So, you folks in Phoenix, Minneapolis, and Kansas City...go...you will love it!!  :-)
124149619252_10153780999604253:Can't wait for our next meal, and the one after that, and....on and on....Merry Christmas, Chipotle's...!!!
124149619252_10153429807864253:You've come along way since that tiny eatery down the street because you made delicious food the right way. I would talk about how great this place was to my army buddies, until you opened your first DC location and they got to experience it for themselves. I've eaten here at least once a week for the last twenty years. Hopefully it will be another twenty. Congrats on your success.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito, light pinto beans, white rice, light mild salsa, hot salsa and cheese. Side of hot salsa to go with it
124149619252_10153246130479253:The only way to truly make a wave is to go fully certified organic. http://outoftheordinaryphotos.blogspot.com/2015/04/celebrating-eating-same-foods-minus-few.html
124149619252_10152786808474253:Sorry, Joe, I love the meats but honestly veggie is where it's at. No sacrifice on flavor, but you get to hit that guac for free.
124149619252_10153246130479253:I would rather hear that they stopped using antibiotics in their meat like McDonalds announced- that's a far bigger threat.
124149619252_10151258924194253:Thank you for giving your wonderful employees the day off to spend with their families. Just another reason why I love Chipotle!!
124149619252_10150163730979253:My baby is probably going to come out looking like that with as much Chipotle as I've been craving this pregnancy.  Mmm, hot salsa...
124149619252_10151089035244253:Beaverton, OR Then Salem, OR .When I lived in Beaverton, and when I moved I would go in. They'd always remember me and my order. Greeted me as soon as I was in, and had it made before I even reached the front. Always had smiles on their faces. Then, some moved to open the Salem store. They still remembered even after a year or more without seeing them. I take anyone I'm with who has never been there...there. If they have been, well then that's just where we're stopping even with it being an hour and 45 minutes away and then just an hour. I'd have to say the most fun is Halloween and dressing up in foil. Sorry for the WOT, but I <3 me some Chipotle!
124149619252_10153009001449253:If u were a true American u would not eat at this establishment that is adhearing to Muslum beliefs!!!
124149619252_10153232136249253:It's all unnecessary slaughter of animals. No matter how you twist it or add fluffy nice words to it. It's all animal torture. There is absolutely no such thing as "humane meat". You are eating a dead animal's flesh, muscle and veins.    Also if you get a veggie bowl, guac is included ????
124149619252_10151024826814253:I eat chipotle today and onestly i was the worst burrito i ever eat before, i am gonna star making my own burritos @ home.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Now if you stop that annoying bag ad campaign...  BTW, hybrid crops (including those done by splicing) are technically genetic engineering.
124149619252_10153500356834253:I love Chipotle!! When are you going to open a restaurant down river so we can enjoy your food too?????
124149619252_10153693560944253:Bummed about the bad press, I'm just hearing about this!  YES quality ingredients are naturally safer, NO one else is required to test everything.  Sorry for the string of bad luck, y'all.  I'll still be shopping your counters down here in Texas.  PS y'all are awesome for putting in changing tables for me in Austin <3
124149619252_10153656854824253:As a chipotle employee, I can tell u one thing- we are not that calm and collected when we're smashing guac ????????????????????
124149619252_10153280608194253:Still waiting for an answer from you guys as to what type of salt is being used on the food? Is it the regular table salt that has glass and cuts your veins? Or kosher salt? Is there a low sodium mine available?
124149619252_10153009001449253:Mine ran out, no substitutions .. kept my receipt anyways and going to try to get a free one later anyways
124149619252_10152949800154253:Fake Mexican restaurant with third-rate food; just a spin-off of Taco Bell. Just a place for uppity wannabe's who think they're eating something exotic. LOL
124149619252_127768177287696:chipotle is good when it's good. Woodbridge must be needing some management tweaking to get everyone to be there to do their job.  Like keeping the doors open and the guacamole going.  Hunger is serious!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Fajita Bowl with brown and white rice, a little fajita, black beans, chicken, double tomatoes, corn, double cheese, lettuce and hot salsa on the side and chips, hopefully they are warm and salty!!! could eat this all day every day!!! <3
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thank you for paving the way. It goes to show that this can be done. Hopefully, other establishments will follow your example.
124149619252_10152323527922741:Chipolte should stick to cooking and not make socio-economic policy statements in a despicable attempt to promote themselves by lying about others.  I am officially boycotting and avoiding them.  Sell stock before it crashes as a result.  Their ads are false and misleading.
124149619252_454413931302356:My husband and I usually go to our local Chipotle once a week. Not any more. Why not allow the Boy Scouts to set their own policies according to their consciences, and not harass those of us who haven't swallowed the pro-homosexual propaganda? It's not a normal lifestyle, and never will be, no matter how much Orwellian doublespeak they use.
124149619252_10151089035244253:we only have one in Palmdale, Ca and it isn's very big and it is always packed.. sometimes u cant even eat there and have to take it to go ... good food but u guys definitely need to open a second location out here please!!!
124149619252_10153135670549253:I just wolfed down a steak burrito at one of the San Diego area Chiplotles. It was extra delicious thanks to the extra Pico and double meat.
124149619252_10152949800154253:After the worst chips and guac I've ever eaten from Chipotle on Mountain AVe, Upland, CA on Dec 31st, I hope the day off will help in quality control.
124149619252_122372141178171:I am watching it right now. I wish there were more options like your restaurant. You do get a lot of business from me because i know your food is not garbage.
124149619252_10153236016399253:Now if only there was a drive through for moms with kids.  Oh yeah, and diaper changing tables in the bathrooms....
124149619252_10151058843154253:The first LEED platinum building is at Iowa State Univ., and it had dual flush bathrooms for women, lots of windows for outdoor lighting, recycle bins in every room, plants on the roof, lights that dimmed when the sun went down, etc. Your building must have been very expensive and the points to get a platinum rating are very, very difficult to achieve. Please put a Chipotle in Ames, IA!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Fajita Burrito, rice, onions and peppers, NO beans, cheese, lettuce, tomatoe and corn salsa, sour cream...YUMMY! :)
124149619252_10153388589524253:Too bad you won't put enough other ingredients in the tortilla to fill it up.  What is with your new miniature sized burritos and burrito bowls?
124149619252_10153009001449253:I think it's great that chipotle is doing this, i don't know how other chipotles function, but i was at chipotle a few months ago and noticed that the way the hot plates of beef and chicken are close to the tofu rice and beans. Also close to the beans with pork. When the girl was serving the person next to me i noticed that the juice of the meat poured a little on the tofu, and some of the juice of beans with pork also poured on another vegeterian option. I would suggest chipotle to completely separate  all the vegan/vegeterian options from the meat and beans. Literally on another side of the hot food bar. I was upset because i wasn't able to try the tofu after seeing that. LOOK OUT PEOPLE!!! (vegeterians/vegans) i haven;t eaten there because of that.
124149619252_193346814021706:We need a Chipotle in Warrenton or Culpeper VA. I have to drive 45 minutes to eat at Chipotle and would love nothing more than to have one closer to me.
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito w/ double tortilla, double white rice, pinto beans, double chicken, every salsa, sour cream, cheese, guac, and lettuce and an apology to the person who has to wrap it
124149619252_10152883478794253:I really love, love, love chipotle but I love and stand by our men and women who risk everything for us more. I'm so sad and disappointed that you employ such a disrespectful person and I'm going to miss you Chipotle
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thank you, thank you!! This is so huge and so appreciated!! I am in my fifties! It isn't just millennial a that care about GMOs. It effects all of us!!
124149619252_10152262999499253:I stopped eating this stuff the moment bacon was removed from the pinto beans, it's not Mexican food, it's fad douche food...
124149619252_183772721660585:Had it for Valentines Day with my Best Friend and Soul mate... my husband Robert along with a 36 year anniversary celebration...
124149619252_10153185651299253:Just had my 2 chipotle stop this week today. After 12 years.of being a faithful customer you guys make awesome food still i never get tired of it.
124149619252_10151024826814253:jaz rice, black beans and the hot salsa.......then more tab sauce......im good and out the door........yum
124149619252_10152538683134253:Interesting... because the guac I got today at your Ashburn, Va. location had brown stringy bits in it. It did not look very appetizing. When I asked for another they just gave me more of the same brown guac!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Use to get free burritos for dressing up as a burrito on Halloween also around Christmas for donating an article of clothing for charity... Guess it's not technically free but still wish you did both of these
124149619252_10153395310879253:Okay there were plenty of people supporting chick Fil a. As a gay man I still eat there and care not who they support its food they have freedom to do so. Same for Chipotle they just said they supported this so good on them for affirming a belief. Believe what you feel passionate about but don't make it legal to discriminate for something you don't like. That goes for anybody.
124149619252_10153267989814253:Sam Logsdon -I went to tag you to see if you were down without realizing this is the day I leave for Kinnection :(
124149619252_10153806089609253:This use to be one of my favorite places to eat at and I would go several times a week, but I'm just so fed up with the bad portions I stopped going.  For the last year, I kept getting less and less Chicken.  I had no problem with the price, but now the portions are far too stingy to justify $7.50 for mostly rice and beans (and several pieces of Chicken)
124149619252_10153246130479253:I should of added and cares for other living things on earth and the environment  more then the all mighty dollar.
124149619252_10153656854824253:This Guac just turnt a mexican dude to a black guy then to a white chick...sold! I'll take 10 of those
124149619252_10153270305244253:Thanks for posting this while I'm unable to do anything about it since you don't have any chipotles in Montreal!!
124149619252_10153236016399253:Wow - referring to the people requiring indolent &/or lazy doesn't help advertisement of your product Chipotle! Additionally, from what I've read so far - the delivery fee is excessively outrageous!!! I'd rather replicate my meal at home for cheaper & quicker service
124149619252_10152996855759253:If you put Sweet Tea over here in New England I would think about it but you wanna be stubborn and keep it a down south thing lol...
124149619252_10151719407409253:I had them all at about 8:40 but got times out twice... Submit button was working on iOS though everytime... This one was rather easy!
124149619252_10153132892604253:great now I'm hungry for Chipotle and there isn't one between me and work, how about someone fixes that for me. YOu can put one next door if you like.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Bayer makes a cancer causing pesticide and oh by the way they make a drug to treat cancer. And these biotech trolls think big chem is the way to go.  http://nwrage.org/content/bayer-profit-causing-and-treating-cancer
124149619252_10152250518069253:http://archive.digtriad.com/news/watercooler/article/288459/176/Chipotle-Admits-To-Using-Some-Genetically-Modified-Food-Items
124149619252_10152406485254253:Thank you, Chipotle, for listening to Moms Demand Action for GenSense I'm America. Now I'm looking forward to my next meal at Chipotle. 
124149619252_10152250518069253:Well it should have been. Great marketing. And a lil customer appreciation goes a long way. So does how u responded to this "hoax"..
124149619252_256556984380282:The festival was awesome but you ran out of the Chili by the time I got there. I hope you bring all 4 of the new items featured at the fest to the restaurants. The new tacos were really good!
124149619252_213189592025031:And for those of you, Daniel, who choose your actions against what Earth day is actually about, taking care of where we live because we only have one planet, I cant wait for it to bite you all right back in the ass :)
124149619252_10153246130479253:The sad thing is, non-GMOs are in no way better for you than GMOs. We've been using GMO corn for a couple decades now without anyone knowing or caring. There is absolutely nothing harmful about it.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Umm they have organic corn ppl thats non gmo...u can go to the store now  and buy chips that are non gmo wow  ppl..thanks chipotle!!! Woot woot !!:D ????
124149619252_182078509223:It's just not Chipotle without the steak! But at least the veggie-lovers can join in on the Chipotle love!
124149619252_454413931302356:I don't eat at Chick Fil A anymore due to their stance on gay rights, and obviously, animal rights.  I heard that Chipotle is now offering vegan choices...is this true?  If so, I will be headed there this weekend!
124149619252_10153246130479253:GMOs are poison. Those of you blindly accepting them are dumber than a box of rocks. Monsanto doesnt care about you.
124149619252_10153736393409253:You don't cook the chicken enough.  And maybe the food warming or cooling tables temp controls are off.  And stop buying produce from Mexico.  I love Chipotle but you cannot sacrifice your standards to keep the line moving fast.
124149619252_10151185000424253:Proceeds go to Chipotle's cultivate foundation, which helps work towards bringing back farms and more sustainable food. You are aren't buying a two dollar burrito, you're getting a burrito because you're donating to charity.
124149619252_10152883478794253:Bri Markridge Vada Lauchlan lolz to when Vades got that random chipotname email during our study sesh
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak bowl, white rice,normal beans, lettuce, corn, sour cream and red sauce!! Yum!! Yum!!! My favorite one! 
124149619252_10151934460309253:And thanks for sticking to your words http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/10/18/chipotle-phase-out-gmos-and-raise-prices-2014?cmpid=tp-ptnr-foodbabe
124149619252_10151024826814253:Carnitas fajita burrito with rice, lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream and guac.  You can keep the beans.  Yummy.
124149619252_492523374093310:I eat here 2, sometimes 3 times a week. It's too good not to...definitely a regular. Yay for the riverside plaza-best location ever!
124149619252_10152250518069253:chipotle is nice how they handle there post about free food  it not like there charging 500% mark up on there stuff
124149619252_185864848093833:This is bull!  How hard is it just to forget about the greed and feed our food the green?  I mean come on people!
124149619252_10152104828699253:I love Chipotle's.  I just wish they'd find a way to keep the food, esp the rice, HOT by the time I sit down in the restaurant to eat it.  It usually just luke warm IF I"M LUCKY and that's frustrating.  They also seem to skimp on the rice lately.  Other than that, I love the.
124149619252_454413931302356:And I don't see how Chipotle is BULLYING the Boy Scouts.  Its not like they're actively funding an Anti-BoyScout Camp that wants to Pray Away the BoyScoutiness of your confused Boy Scouts.  They're simply NOT doing something.  They're not DOING something, they're NOT doing something, totally different.
124149619252_10153489055424253:Its the corn that has me hooked. Chicken burrito, light white rice, black beans, sour cream, corn, MORE sour cream, MORE corn, fist full of cheese... done in that order
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito: rice, black beans, steak (if not over cooked), tomato salsa, corn salsa, hot salsa, sour cream and cheese!  Yummy!!  Perfect!!! 
124149619252_10153602183249253:Very glad to hear this because if it was true I would have never gone to Chipotle again. Now I can go today as planned!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito-black beans-brown rice-more beans-just a little chicken-hot sauce-sour cream-thankyouverymuch!
124149619252_10151089035244253:I liked Chipotle until I watched the founder on some cooking contest show.  He was absolutely obnoxious and arrogant week after week.  Haven't been back since......
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl with a lot of rice, little bit of black beans, chicken, mild salsa, a little bit of sour cream and cheese. Yum!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Love the nonGMO menu, keep up the good work and looking forward to supporting Panera. Whole Foods is following suit too:)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl, white rice, black beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, extra cheese and lettuce. I top it off with both red and green tobasco... liberal amounts of it too. :) Mmmmm...
124149619252_109031815838831:The team at chipotle in Nashville on west end is awesome.  My husband and I go there on our date days while our daughter is at school.  Usually there is a line to the door and the guys behind the line are always happy and always smiling.  Thanks!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Carnitas Bowl with Pinto Beans, a little corn, medium salsa, sour cream, cheese and guacamole. Add some jalapeno Tabasco as needed.
124149619252_10151086390274253:I love it. I took a 7 hour bus all the way from Newcastle upon Tyne, for the sole purpose of getting a PROPER burrito. Hope it tasted as good to her as it to did to me. Good luck/well done! :D
124149619252_10153066985824253:Tried Chipotle for the first and last time. Steak was so dry. Tried my sons  chicken and it was dry too. Plus $1.50 for guacamole? Won't ever go back.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Man I miss chipotle, been in Afghanistan For about 7 months now and one of the first things I'm doing when I get home is eating a fajita bowl with half steak and chicken, tomato and corn salsa, lettuce and chips.
124149619252_10152250518069253:When a new location opened you guys gave away free burritos all day for the grand opening.  I have been to 2 of those.  Sooooo
124149619252_10153867363919253:So glaaddd to hear today's news!!!! Wooohooooo!!!!! This calls for CHIPOLTE DINNER!!!  so excited I just wanna hug ya!! ...????????????????????????????
124149619252_10153009001449253:Had to laugh after reading so many posts about locations being out of sofritas early. I live in Redding, CAconservative, lots of farming and huntingand our location had "plenty," in the words of one of the employees when we called to check. And so they did, as we bought five burritos for our familyand were surprised to see so many people who weren't buying sofritas but willing to wait in the line, which snaked around the entire perimeter of the restaurant and nearly out the door...
124149619252_10153569576059253:Just seen this same sight at my local Chipotle in Sandusky oh too bad the grill cook touched all the raw steak to throw on the grill then didn't  take his latex glove off but walked over and grabbed the cooked chicken to put it in the stainless steel container.
124149619252_10150602702709253:Hey the ad you ran during the grammys was awesome :) we need more commercials like that instead of GM food that is made from a machine....right on Chipotle
124149619252_10151961054499253:Rice was undercooked in my burrito bowl this eve; they also forgot to add the corn, even though I requested "everything." Ruined the meal.  :(
124149619252_10153389325099253:Jacob Roundy Brady Detwiler Connor Fitzgerald Strader Andy Stocker Bradley Cooper Reggie Fils-Aimé we gotta GET ON THIS NOW
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak fajita bowl with extra veggies,rice,mild and corn salsa with extra cheese,and sour cream and lettuce.oh sooo good :)
124149619252_10153533436764253:The meatballs every time. I had them at a festival in Irving and am still waiting for them to be a regular staple in Texas.
124149619252_10153602183249253:Gracie Deon Wyrick I saw you shared the magazine picture and I shared it always because it made me mad but my sister saw this and tagged me in it so I thought I'd share it with you
124149619252_10151267410249253:Hey joe el restaurante de la 104 federal en denver es lo mejor q me a pasado el restaurante esta muy limpio el servisio es great ilove chipotle felizidades
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak bowl with white rice, black beans, corn salsa, sour cream, guacamole and a touch of lettuce... To die for!!
124149619252_10151307314369253:Not everyone in America celebrates Christmas...as Americans we should support our fellow Americans despite their religious preference. I would support Chipotle no matter what their choice was...bottom line...if a business is open and their employees work...they get paid!
124149619252_10153246130479253:The no GMO is a big step forward for you and will bring back many customers :). If on the road I'll stop in there versus going hungry till I arrive at my destination :).  Once you go all organic or at least a good percentage organic and local I'll be an occasional customer as I don't have many places to eat out based on my healthy lifestyle and usually limited to my own cooking which is rough when so busy.  ::Thumbs Up::  I definitely won't drink your sodas or eat the meat which is fed GMO. Once organic grass fed beef or organic fed chicken will that change.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak bowl-white rice, black beans,fajita veggies, extra cheese, extra sour cream, lettuce, mild and green salsa with a bag of chips.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl w/ white rice, fajita veggies, chicken, sour cream and LOTS of corn salsa! Wish I had a bowl RIGHT NOW! :)
124149619252_10151089035244253:i hate the ones with the layout like this. i saw these layouts for the first time in CT. I like the one on The Alameda in San Jose the best. It's my favorite. Plus, the cops frequent it so I feel kinda safe being there at night. lol.
124149619252_10152453918534253:Love Chipotle but Little Rock has cheapened the chicken (several bites of gristle with each burrito)!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak Burrito. White Rice, little bit of black beans, steak, pico de gallo, salsa verde, cheese, lettuce, and drizzle with vinaigrette. Fitting end to a day full of longboarding.
124149619252_10151089035244253:They are all my favorite!!! As long as it is a chipotle..... Its My favorite! I can't get enough. Bel air, md - my home location and hunt valley, md - my work location ;0)
124149619252_10152250518069253:I get double wrapped burritos with double rice, double beans, double chicken, and salsa and they only sometimes charge for double chicken. Seems like a good deal to me.
124149619252_10153708605069253:Yep, gotta remove the foil as you eat. Never take it completely out at the start. Otherwise your 'rito becomes a sloppy joe.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl with white rice, chicken,  sauteed veggies, tomatillo salsa, corn salsa, guacamole and a lil extra cilantro!
124149619252_10152406485254253:actually it's about money. Which Chipotle will start losing if they continue to skirt their responsibility to keep their customers safe.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl, white rice, no beans extra rice, extra chicken. Sour cream, bury it in cheese. Top it off with some tobasco sauce. Wash it down with a Mr. Pibb with a fresh lemon slice in it.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Mindy Ranney GMO crops actually use fewer 'cides than do other crops.  Organic crops also use pesticides, more of them and in heavier doses, than conventional or GMO crops.
124149619252_10153246130479253:And for those who seem thoroughly confused about "GMO's," do yourself a favor and educate yourselves about what's in the food you eat.  "Food Inc." ???? is a great place to start!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Nicole, looks like a ton of other people nation wide had the same problem we did. Poor planning on chipotle's part all the way around.
124149619252_10153232136249253:Sorry Chipotle.... all of the meat you're serving up is still  GMO. Unless those animals are being raised on ORGANIC grain or are GRASS FED, they are GMO.
124149619252_267832333301923:Peopel need to realize chipotle isn't selling these bags for profit. You get a cool bag made from a chipotle billboard sign and in the porcess you make farmers who strive to give us healthy food at a good price a little happier.
124149619252_10152883504929253:I just love Chipotle, my whole family does. No artificial flavors! How refreshing is that? I would love to have one closer, maybe in South Jersey, that would be great!!
124149619252_10151058843154253:San Jose, near Santana Row. its a LEED Platinum certified building because of the material and design really make it over all environmentally friendly..example..the windows allow natural light inside which reduces the amount of energy used to use indoor lighting..not to mention the wind trubine...  my university has multiple LEED Certified Buildings! LOVE IT!
124149619252_10151024826814253:crispy tacos with carnitas, black beans, corn salsa, sour cream, lettuce, cheese, and of course guacamole!!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken burrito, white, black, cheese, medium guac, lettuce had it for the past 5 days in a row #yolo
124149619252_10152560126959253:Burrito or bowl, extra brown rice, half chicken, half carnitas, Corn salsa, cheese, and lettuce... mmmmmmm
124149619252_10152323527922741:There are so many names and harsh words that come to mind when trying to think of something to say to all of you in support of this but instead I will take the high road and simply say educative yourself...using CREDITABLE sources! And guess what, this backstabbing sorry excuse of a food chain is not one. If you want to know FACTS, talk to a professor  at a university that deals with whatever sector of agriculture you have a question about. If you want to know how animals are handled and cared for, go to a farm and ask questions. Ask them why they do this or that with their animals and I can bet you there is a logical answer behind every question and it involves the betterment of the livestock. I am tired of uninformed and misguided people attacking my life style when I never come to your place of work and tell you I don't like what you are doing and you need to do it differently. Why doesn't everyone just stop and be thankful that they live in a country with the safest food supply in the world and that there's someone out there doing the dirty work to produce your food so you don't have to. Without food you don't exist, with out farmers and ranchers you don't exist. Wether you like to believe it or not, agriculture is the backbone of this country, always has been and always will be.
124149619252_10151089035244253:the locations I've been to in California. I live in Washington and those locations make SKIMPY burritos!!!
124149619252_182078509223:boo vegan. more meat choices! nothing but meat cheese and rice on mine thank you very much, extra meat
124149619252_10153132892604253:It is but last time I ate it at Wellington Chipotle it gave me and my husband bad stomach cramps for a short while.
124149619252_10151024826814253:I LOVE THIS CHIPOTLE CHICKEN BURRITO W WHITE RICE,LETUCE,TOMATOES W ONION,WHITE CHEESE N SOUR CREAM MMMMMMMM DELICIOUS......
124149619252_455264284485429:Beth Barmore-Lamb Our pinto beans are prepared with naturally raised bacon, and our black beans are prepared with soybean oil, for which answer please see two comments above. Thanks! - Joe
124149619252_10153830182809253:Yeah I read all stores will close for 1 business day to try and re-evaluate... whatever that means. All stores. I prefer Qdoba any day of the week over Chipotle.  Jmo
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak, black beans, fajita veggies, green salsa, lettuce, sour cream, and cheese. The burrito I bought today was bigger than some small countries! Good to know you're not skimping your customers in bad financial times!
124149619252_10151024826814253:bowl; half chicken half steak, white rice, black beans, peppers & onions, corn salsa, lil fresh salsa and a pinch of lettuce.  no sour cream no cheese.
124149619252_10152738663064253:Wendy, nothing in life is "free", never has been never will be. Pissed off people on FB and the internet as a whole, well there's something of a surprise. Seriously, people need to get over themselves.
124149619252_10152925087634253:That's great you do that for your employees!  However I have a medical condition that requires me to consume Chipotle everyday.... What am I supposed to do now?
124149619252_199537401806:When will it land in Europe?!?!?! Just so you know, there are a LOT of expats and locals alike waiting for Chipotle to finally open its doors here.
124149619252_10151089035244253:If you had one here near Ft. Knox, KY tht would be my favorite! Whenever I go home to Ohio I have to go to Chipotle it's a must!!!!!
124149619252_10153389325099253:Im not bc we dont have one! :-( please put one in Ephrata Pa! They keep putting in nasty fast food joints! And ew to taco bell!
124149619252_10151024826814253:OK here's a good one. You get a cheese Quesadilla and open it up then make a chicken burrito with it. The Quesadilla Burrito!!!! Perfect amount of crunch to add to Chipotles perfect burritos
124149619252_10152323527922741:It's justified because it's proving a point that almost everything people eat is made from genetically modified material and a company like Chipotle isn't buying into cheap ingredients to make money. They care about the customer and provide only ingredients that are not processed or modified in any way. I don't think it's necessarily an opinion of the corporation Marcy Ward but I think they're trying to get the word out about where most "food" really comes from. You should watch Food Inc. It's a great eye opener.
124149619252_157777224183:Wow! Another politically correct company making the impression of going green. Other than that B.S. just keep making good burritos. I don't care if you have to burn 500 old dinosaurs to do it!!!!!
124149619252_10153236016399253:Nimar Kahlon NIMZZZY/ remember BOGO burrito at ucla. prob the few times we ate together post dining hall
124149619252_341532579201452:Moes is garbage compared to the quality ingredients you get at Chipotle. Love everything about you chipotle!
124149619252_164816057005566:I am game and ready to try it!  If I don't like it I will go back to the standard vegetarian burrito bowl I normally get, but love having another option like the meat-eaters do!
124149619252_10151024826814253:A chicken bowl with brown rice, black beans, tomato salsa, extra corn and sourcream, lettuce and chesse. Yum!!
124149619252_455264284485429:Thanks Joe for your quick response.  I do understand that sometimes, its hard pleasing all.  Vegans have a hard time eating out with trust, that their food doesn't contain ANY animal products in them.  Just wanting more places to eat our without worry.   
124149619252_10151687038594253:seriously chipotle, fix the bug that makes everyone LOG back in EVERY time to submit a new answer.   Puh-leeze!  and by the way, you sent me a text with an eight digit code, and on your website it tells me to enter a VALID code.....?!
124149619252_10150959152619253:If we're placing requests for new locations, then the following request should be EASY. Can we have Shrimp on the menu as well as Spinach Tortillas? Thanks.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Kinda funny how our cancer rates increased dramatically when we started eating more and more GMOs (and sugar, and pesticides, etc.). But ok, you who think this is a bad idea just go enjoy something else while I eat my sofritos in peace. This isn't going to solve all of our food problems, but bravo to Chipotle for taking a step in a good direction.
124149619252_10153246130479253:I assume this means you will no longer sell any form of corn or rice developed in the last few hundred years correct?
124149619252_363324750372027:SO excited to just find out that your building a chipotle near me- WE DID travel an hour to get to one-- (ever notice how much healthier the average chipotle customer looks compared to other fast food)
124149619252_10153246130479253:Excellent! Is it now possible that you will become a vegan restaurant? I see you have vegan options, but it would be great to see Chipotles go comnpletely plant-based...
124149619252_10153232136249253:I once took a bite of a Carnitas burrito at Chipotle and realized it was a huge gob of pure pig fat. I literally puked in the restaurant. Thanks, chipotle.
124149619252_10152406485254253:I had no idea it was so dangerous to eat at Chipotle!  What, exactly, are you defending yourself against?  Paranoia will destroy ya, people.
124149619252_10152560126959253:Chicken burrito bowl with both rice (extra brown rice), both beans, fajitas, mild and hot salsas, corn salsa, cheese, lettuce, sour cream on the side and a tortilla on the side. I easily have enough for two meals :D #collegestudentpriorities
124149619252_10151809543439253:Went to your Delaware OH store and the cashier asked me to hold on while she bags the trash. Then she does, bags my food and takes me credit card without washing hands!!!! So upset and grossed out I threw my food away.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Where the hell do you people live?  $12 a burrito?  Ours has slowly risen to like... $6.50 or something from $5.50 in 2006.  I wouldn't even go to Chipotle if it was $12.
124149619252_163075200578:A best kept secret - Chipotle has one of the best Margaritas I've ever tasted. I've scientifically tested this myself at several Cleveland area locations. Now you know!
124149619252_10151024826814253:"chicken bowl, white rice, no beans, mild medium, corn, cheese and guac...i know it's extra! oh and can i please have some limes?"
124149619252_10151687038594253:I won the year of Free burritos, and the burrito bucks are for one burrito, not for $1.. Keep playing , I hope to win 20 years of burritos
124149619252_10150256700954253:HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHIPOTLE and one of my favs places to eat.  Today I was your Burrito Winner in PD, CA.  WOO HOO!!!  Burritos galore!
124149619252_10153132892604253:Lol ... Hate when they tell me "that's gonna be extra" OK!!! Like I'm gonna say "ohhhh, then never mind ...." ????????????
124149619252_10153780999604253:Chipotle rocks and rules fast food!  Enjoying in Aventura FL and will continue to do so!  Happy Holidays, see you soon!!
124149619252_10152560126959253:Hi Chipotle, love you guys.  I wanted to ask if all the restaurants have unsweetened iced tea.  I sometimes see it and sometimes I don't.  Trying to get away from soda and wasn't sure if this was an option at all the restaurants. Thanks.
124149619252_10153200118729253:Honest to Goodness that's how I was introduced to Chipotle. Left the guy now but Guac and a bowl are always there for me. ALWAYS.
124149619252_10153389325099253:In Akron where unfortunately there are uncook chicken....i started to eat at hot headz...meat is done...
124149619252_160584150738666:I usually get the Carnita Meat at Chipotle. Last time I was there, I got daring and tried the Barbacoa Meat. I Loved it! New Favorite.
124149619252_10152082036279253:Are they GMO free?  Will you still be going GMO free by next year, because that is less than a month away?
124149619252_10152560126959253:Still waiting on the special for Nurses!! Nurses week was a long time ago! You supported the teachers with a free meal....
124149619252_10150256700954253:awesome!  too bad we've only had them in Toledo for 4 years. we missed out on 14 years of deliciousness!
124149619252_10152323527922741:It's a marketing stunt...they are counting on the consumers laziness not to research just run with the info no matter how absurd!
124149619252_10153389325099253:Anywhere I can find one.  Nearest is 20 miles from home, but must get up to Lakeville, MN about once a week!  Worth the drive!  :-)
124149619252_10152406485254253:Don't have Chipolte in Augusta, GA.  Please come!  And thank you for making the sane decision.  If I walked into any establishment and saw two Bubbas like that, I would leave immediately.  And if those two Bubbas entered after I had ordered, I would also leave, with unpaid bill.
124149619252_10150672519564253:Please come to Ottawa even if it's just temporary.....I've been to every Chipotle in Michigan your Vancouver local, every Chipotle in the Toronto area, your Paris France & Germany locations and have converted many to Chipotle addicts.......no other Mexican/burrito place has ANYTHING on you guys.....even if it was just for Winterlude I would skate the entire canal 3x DAILY!!
124149619252_10150719072154253:I was def. disappointed that chipotle was closed yesterday.. drove all the way over for nothing lol..
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl - brown rice, black beans, fajita veggies, barbacoa, double portion of pico de gallo, red chili sauce, green chili sauce, lettuce.
124149619252_10152250518069253:This may not have been real but a large company such as this could maybe offer a discount or free chips and salsa to the loyal public that follows and likes your restaurants!!
124149619252_10152407734029253:Hey chipotle, I'm always packing and I just came out of one of your cheesy as$ restaurants... What you gonna do about it?!
124149619252_10153563062919253:Did Chipotle change their recipe?  The last time I had the burrito bowl it tasted bland with no seasoning.
124149619252_10152935096524253:San Jose California Cottle Road location.. Worst burrito I've ever had in my life. The steak burrito was horrible because it was cold and it had too much gristle in it that I couldn't chew and ended up spitting out most of the meat. I live 3 minutes from there and got home and ate it and it was already cold like I had gotten it out of the refrigerator.. I will never eat there again and I will tell everybody that I can!!!
124149619252_10152250518069253:OMG people...the level of butthurt and entitled behavior is UNBELIEVABLE. YOU are what is wrong with the world. Chipotle, you rock! Get a freaking grip, people. There are MUCH bigger problems in this world.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Crispy tacos with steak, corn salsa, lettuce, cheese, and sour cream and a side of guacamole with chips
124149619252_10153602183249253:Perhaps you should contact Facebook direct and ask them to take it down.  I reported the picture to them and was told it didn't violate their terms. Go figure@
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl, no rice. Black beans, half carnitas half steak, cheese & lettuce. Pico, sour cream & guacamole on the side with a side of chips ;)
124149619252_228034027252006:You guys act like we've forgotten that you used to give away FREE BURRITOS on Halloween...$2 is unacceptable.
124149619252_10153246130479253:OMG! Farmers are great people, some of the best I know.  But they are completely brainwashed by these bio-technology seed companies.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie burrito with white rice, black beans, diced tomatoes, extra lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and guac! I actually like it better than chicken from back before I became a vegetarian.
124149619252_10152676820799253:Healthy food and Vegan friendly... The veggie burritos are a meal in itself. The price for the food is equal to the value, more that enough.. half for lunch rest for dinner... that's Value
124149619252_183772721660585:Congrats..... How about that military discount!! Man Chipotle is so Patriotic that they decided to give their men and woman in the Armed Forces a 10 percent military dicount just like the terrible company Moes!!!! Wooo Hooo !!! LOL. Just Sayin!
124149619252_10151058843154253:I read that a Chipotlé in Denver got this award. But what makes it special is that.... Oh wait, IT'S CHIPOTLÉ!!!! That's a special thing about it right there
124149619252_10150959152619253:Could tell it was an airport, but that's all I had.  Would LOVE to see a closeup of the art wall there just right of center.  Looks extra cool!
124149619252_10153643599234253:You need to train your employees to mix up the ingredients once they make the burrito. Makes a better burrito.
124149619252_10152881169974253:We did this tonight for a party on a yacht. Worked out great! We ordered food for 20, and had 16 adults eat, and plenty of left overs! We easy to set up, and came with everything we needed. Pleased the vegetarians, gluten free guest, and us carnivores!
124149619252_10151089035244253:It WOULD be downtown Cleveland if you put one at Cleveland State University.. But i guess I'll have to settle for Willoughby, Ohio..
124149619252_10152250518069253:How  does  the   hoax  begin?  Still  I  think  if  u  guys  give  out  a  freebie  it  would  still  bring  in  more  customers.  BOGO's  r  always  fun!
124149619252_10152935096524253:Open the Fargo location faster. This constitutes torture for people who live in cities without a Chipotle. I went to Qdoba the other day ... It was awful!
124149619252_202478973111117:I live in Anchorage and have a hard time describing why Chipotle is so much better than Qdoba. It just is, ingredients are better! I miss Chipotle so much! Please come to Anchorage!
124149619252_10153071208839253:What would be doubly awesome is to win a chipotle gift card and to go back and discover that Carnitas is back!   Love chipotle!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl!! lots of cilantro lime rice, Pinto/Black beans (i like both) barbacoa non of the sauces... guac,lots of sour cream and cheese and lettuce!!
124149619252_10153246130479253:You're okay with tomatoes infused with flounder genes? Bleh. Chemically enhanced corn....no thank you. I'm not okay with GMO foods. And companies like this one coming out all glorious saying they've stopped using them? Well i just feel like they should be ashamed to have used them in the first place. No pat on the back for doing what you should've never done. No thank you either.
124149619252_199537401806:Alaska should be next. I was dying without it. I tried to eat qudoba as a substitute but I almost vomited! PLEASE come to alaska!!!!!
124149619252_10152406485254253:Lay off the Faux News for CHRIST'S SAKES?! I bet NONE of your antics would be going on if ROMNEY was in the White House ? Yet PLEASE?! Keep up the good work making the Republican Party look STUPID.
124149619252_10150298717314253:This why I love you Chipotle! I miss my Chipotle by DU now that I live in Bend, OR. Y'all would be a perfect fit here in Central Oregon.
124149619252_10151086390274253:Wife is bringing me some from the Vendais Heights, MN, location because Duluth, MN doesn't have one! I guarantee there would be a huge profit. There are several cities surrounding Duluth that are closer then Vedais Heights. Such as Superior, WI, Proctor, Hermantown, Cloquet, all out-laying towns, and within a 45-65 min drive. So, we need one in this location!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito Bowl - rice, black beans, medium salsa, onions, tomato, corn, capsicum, sour cream, cheese, and guacamole to top it!
124149619252_10152949800154253:I think it's cool that a company still gives their employees holidays off.  Well done, Chipotle, well done.  Employees, even in retail and food service (major sarcasm!), deserve time off, too.
124149619252_329592670434256:So, I drove a two-hour round-trip to the nearest Chipotle twice, and went out of my way to go to the third on a trip, but my 'follow Chipotle' didn't go through before, so I don't get the badge or qualify for the competition. Gas is too expensive for the six hour round-trip it'd take to eat chipotle another three times. What a waste. I coulda used free burritos for a year.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Gmo corn is no longer listed as a food but as a pesticide by the EPA.  You can find it on the EPA website. Thank you Chipotle!  The people want choice and you listened. Hopefully this will set the stage for others to follow!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito Bowl, extra white rice, no beans, chicken with mild salsa, corn, cheese and lettuce with a side of chips and medium salsa....mmmm....I'm hungry now...
124149619252_10152236327209253:Good on you Chipotle for providing cruelty free options at your restaurants. Now all you need is some vegan sour cream to offer with it and I'll be a regular customer!
124149619252_10153009001449253:So i have to eat tofu in order to eat meat for free? That's almost tempting but then again I'd rather just pay for the chicken and know ill like it
124149619252_10153009001449253:Sofritas are my faaaaaaaave!!! Thanks so much for giving me another meatless option other than the veggie.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Whichever meat looks best at the time, fajita peppers, white rice, tomato, corn, cheese and lettuce. Oh and cant forget the Chipotle Tabasco. I get his about three times a week!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Just speaking for Illinois locations: Westmont & Willowbrook are thee best and freshest!  All other locations are just ok..
124149619252_10151089035244253:HUNTINGTON, NY is by far the BEST Chipotle.  The food is absolutely fantastic and the staff is very friendly!
124149619252_10153693560944253:are your veggies safe to feed to my bunny yet? he loves your food and gets silly when I feed him! ????
124149619252_10153246130479253:Why? Additional cost with no benefit. There are over 1,000 published, peer reviewed studies on their safety. You aren't going to use non GMO fed livestock because that is entirely too expensive, also with no benefit. I love your food, but dislike your pseudoscientific policy done without evidence
124149619252_454413931302356:Do it for the kids even if the adults are hatemongers. I get it. Tell ya what. Ill buy them all chipotles myself if the join the Girl Scouts instead. They can still get tasty burritos and learn to be a good upstanding citizen without all the bigotry.
124149619252_157777224183:sure hope you don't pass along the costs of that overpriced energy source to me the customer who has already seen a 40% increase in prices over the last 4 years.....
124149619252_10153009001449253:Thank you! Enjoying my late night dinner right now. It's quite good but I'm going back for my usual Barbacoa next time. I don't eat much meat at all, sticking only with organic/hormone + antibiotic-free with a preference for grass fed, so this is a treat a few times per month. I'll tell my vegan friends about it though! :)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Double wrapped chicken fajita burrito with brown cilantro-lime rice, pico de gallo, corn salsa, cheese, lettuce, sour cream
124149619252_10153806089609253:Chipotle maybe all of these things but it is still a big pile of fat and calories and it isnt that good
124149619252_105860719543628:People.. stop complaining about the price. You are getting good quality and paying "about the same" as a meal at other fast food places that do Not compare!
124149619252_10153542268884253:Meghann Clayton Veit of course NC State would be on this list.....it was definitely a deciding factor when choosing a school for me...as it should be for everyone...lol!
124149619252_10150262089049253:Hey Joe- Where you going with that Chipotle in your hand!  Ok, seriously, is Chipotle ever going to have a kids menu or maybe there already is one that I'm not aware of?  We're a family of 5, 3 toddlers under the age of 5 and $50 for the family is a tall order.  Thanks!
124149619252_10153395310879253:Let's open Chipotle n the Conyers, Covington, Decatur, Lithonia, Stone Mountain area. That's Georgia baby.
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito bowl, with chicken and steak, black and pinto beans, all 3 sauces, sour cream, corn, with guacamole.  Then an order of chips with guac on the side and a Coke.
124149619252_10151556916969253:Who do we contact about sponsoring our event in Greensboro, NC? Do you have an email address? Thank you.
124149619252_182409608462105:Ah, i do want that! Uh... I haven't ever heard about it, and nope their to show for Ad or announce about haiku contest it? Not fair! Then well, now I am transfer other place the McDonald's
124149619252_10152406485254253:The chipotle on coliseum blvd is ft Wayne Indiana is horrible. It's ran like a 3 am drunken taco tent. Ur loose me as a customer and that's pretty sad considering how much I enjoy the food. Get new mgnt
124149619252_10152406485254253:Looks like my family and I will be eating elsewhere Chipotle, hope it was worth the business you lost!
124149619252_10153720921419253:I'd there any way I can get a voucher for a free bowl? I mean hey, I'm trying to convert my wife to chipotle. I scratch your back. .  .
124149619252_10152715839394253:Chicken bol, white rice, no beans, mild, a crap ton of cheese,  and a bit of sour cream. Love Me some Chipotle! !
124149619252_10152715839394253:Bowl, extra white rice, black beans,  double barbacoa, half spoon mild, 2 medium, corn, cheese, lettuce.  Been making it the exact same way since the first time. However have tried the other meats through family members. This is a man's bowl.
124149619252_10153389325099253:Open a location in Sarajevo, Bosnia. Its one thing I'm missing about Houston right now while im here.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thank you Chipotle!! I travel the country for work and your restaurants are the first thing I look up when I arrive so I know were I can eat. I'm not anti-Gmo per say, nor am I ok with Gmo either, but I AM for being able to have a choice. Thank you for enabling choice!
124149619252_10152748432224253:Mariah Spurlock michael tells me stories how you freak out over chipotle. Lol so I thought of you when I saw this:)
124149619252_10151024826814253:1/2 chicken & steak burrito bowl, fajita veggies, tomato and corn salsas, cheese sour cream guac & lettuce! Low carb ;)
124149619252_205082546217004:i understand this is something of a merit.. however, i would like to add that these consumers are really off base as far as what they consider as "healthy" .. hats off to you Chipotle because you deserve that spot! but i feel saddened by what the general public would rate as healthful.
124149619252_10153602183249253:It shouldn't be guard to figure out who did it if this is a real hoax.  When I see proof I'll believe.  Until then I'm just saddened
124149619252_10153246130479253:Sorry to hear that in the US we have regressed to less efficient means of food production with so many millions starving globally.  Organic and GMO is a selfish way to eat; makes one feel like they are doing good but in fact are doing harm.  There is no scientific support that GMO products pose a health risk plus GMO products have higher yields.
124149619252_127768177287696:Still none in Fort Myers, but I am enjoying the one in Sarasota #10239 as we speak--93 miles from home! (How "GREEN" is this that I have to drive so far so often??? HURRY!!! lol) Have a safe- and very Merry Christmas!
124149619252_10153389325099253:Please come to Oxford, Alabama   On I20 between Atlanta and Birmingham   Brand new exchange needs a Chipotle
124149619252_10150260445594253:Tricia, that's simply not true about the portioning. Sorry. But yes, if you ask for more meat than the normal portion, we'll charge you extra if you want a bunch, "a little more" shouldn't be a problem. - Joe
124149619252_10151626575004253:No a burrito with chicken, guac, brown rice, lettuce, tomatoes, stir fry veggies, and cheese. Lets see them roll that. I order that every time I go to chipotle Mikey Crispin
124149619252_10152082036279253:Pizzeria Locale is great, but EXPENSIVE.  I wish it were priced like Chipotle where you just pick all the toppings you want for a set price, but here, you'll pay for every individual thing you put on, which adds up FAST (think Mad Greens style).  It's a shame.  Also, for the people who didn't bother reading, this is a completely separate business.  Chipotle is not serving pizza.
124149619252_454413931302356:Melanie Thurman as someone who supports gay equality it's cowardice on their behalf and caved into pressure. It wasn't supporting their principles which nothing is wrong with it, but as you said BSA principles are nothing new.
124149619252_140229971715:Check your local chipotle - saw this sign up in a Dallas/Fort Worth, TX chipotle on Tuesday so the offer may be good near you! :)
124149619252_10153903490999253:I ?? Chipotle , Maple Grove MN, alway perfect Steak Barito , and alway clean, great customer service .. Thank you... I eat their every other day , it my dinner favorite ????????
124149619252_159372559415:im not surbrised that 160 ppl love chipotle even though ive acually met lyk 5 ppl literally who have either not heard of chipotle, havent tried it or dont lyk it
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito or bowl white rice black beans chicken and sometimes half carnitas with sour cream corn and cheese...omg sooooo orgasmic!!!!!
124149619252_10153001213604253:Thank you Chipotle for making the right decision not just thinking about money!  I am an even bigger fan now!
124149619252_156053474470:is this price based or in general, Qdoba , for instence, delivers for catering, though you must spend a required amount of money for a delivery, otherwise its a pick up
124149619252_10152883478794253:Super disappointed in you Chipotle... Putting my money somewhere else... You've lost my business and many more ahead...
124149619252_182078509223:wow!!!...Sounds like the vegan will be hungry and shitty...lls....go burrito bowl with chicken that is
124149619252_10152883478794253:I'm tired of having to ask for "extra" EVERYTHING just to get adult portions!!! You raise the price then give "baby scoops" of rice, beans, etc. Then you have the audacity to lie and tell me there is a fee for extra rice when there is not! I use to eat here at least 4 times a week. I'll make it at home! I'm done!
124149619252_10151486609219253:Brown rice, pinto beans, chicken, mild/green/corn salsas, sour cream and cheese.  And always a side of chips and guacamole. I visit my local Chipotle Mexican Grill every other Friday when I get paid.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Wow! I am amazed at all the ignorant people in the world.  If GMOs are so healthy and safe then please tell me why they are banned in most countries?  How is something that is put on or in a plant that kills everything on or around the plant, except the plant itself safe?
124149619252_10152990683604253:A HUGE THANKS ! ! !  I just heard about your choice to suspend use of pork products that did not meet your standards! Your ethical leadership is inspirational. We need a Chipotle here in North Conway NH and I would love to be a franchisee or manager for that store. Either which way,  DO BIG THINGS ! ! !
124149619252_10151855292469253:So I don't get to live near a chipotle while in college--which is already a bummer--and because I don't live near one, I can't win free catering? Sounds backwards to me. We're getting deprived. I make special trips all the time just eat some chipotle.
124149619252_134085872963:nowhere NEAR as good as winner  also creepy  but a reasonable enough attempt, some props for that, just not 5k good
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl - brown rice, chicken, mild, medium and corn salsa with some lettuce on top. Healthy and delicious! 
124149619252_10152250518069253:I'm not stupid! And don't appreciate your ignorance toward the situation! I did check the FB page which contains almost nothing! And if the giveaway was a hoax who's to say the person telling you this wasn't too?  All I was saying was that they do have free giveaways so how were the people  repost supposed to know that? Back off!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken fajita bowl w/ brown rice, tomato salsa, corn salsa, cheese,  guacamole, & lettuce! Mmmmmmm...
124149619252_261338423981855:The owner of Chick-fil-A is not sticking his nose in any social issue. He was asked a question and he answered it. I may not agree with him but it is his right as an American citizen to express his views. Fascism from the left is becoming a dangerous thing in America with the stifling of free speech. I wish there was a Chick-fil-A in New York so I could support them. 
124149619252_10151486609219253:Barbacoa, pinto, medium, light on the sour cream and cheese, chipotle tabasco for whatever falls out.
124149619252_10152883478794253:If the person making the food is holding their hands up and saying "hands up don't ????" How is that not refusing service?  The burrito gonna make itself?
124149619252_115365598544868:Thanks Chipotle! Hadn't heard about Picnic for the Planet until you posted about it a few weeks ago. There are several picnics today around Columbus, OH. Unfortunately it's cold and raining outside. Definitely an inside-picnic day. The troll comments here are uncool. Unlike the page and STOP THE POLLUTION. It's Earth Day!
124149619252_10152560126959253:My experience at chipotle didnt go well.i ordered burrito and dine in there. I found a hair almost im done tht. I was abt to puke and let the server knw wht is goin on.his face expression was like"do not trust me wht i was sayin at all cuz i found out almost finish my meal". And willingly to offer me nothing as an apology and he kept saying"sorry". So i left and decide no more burritti at all in this place and such a nightmare for me ????????????
124149619252_10152406485254253:Sorry your sanity has brought out the whackadoodles. They all eat at Cracker Barrel with their ilk anyway... no worries, your loyal customer won't be going anywhere.
124149619252_454413931302356:We will be eating more often @ Chipotle now that you have kicked the hateful BSA to the curb!!! Bravo. A bonus foe us: no fundie idiots like Joe Mellon to ruin our dining experience!
124149619252_10153224670404253:Oh my Gggoooodddd.....I lovveeee cchhiiippppooottttlllleeee....ccchhhiiipppooottttlleee is my liiiiffffeeee
124149619252_10153009001449253:I have asked Chipotle on several occasions which organic certification agency they use. I have never heard back from them. If they truly used organic ingredients, they couldn't announce that fast enough. Their silence is golden, it tells me that their organic claims are false
124149619252_10151089035244253:i feel a lot of chipotle locations in the manhattan area need to be expanded a little. way too litte wiggle room for lunch in the city. that being said i like the empire state building 34th street location a lot. also the location on 7th ave and 26th street, across from FIT.
124149619252_10151486609219253:White rice, green peppers, onions, double chicken, hot and mild salsa, double cheese, sour cream. Perfection!
124149619252_10152805746454253:Seems like you get more in a bowl IMO.  I always get a bowl and dont let the clerks short me on any ingredients, with a wrap on the side.  I can roll myself a pretty fat burrito and still have half a bowl left!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Chipotle has joined the legions of scientists and geneticists in calling GMOs bad. And by scientists and geneticists, I mean stoners and hippies.
124149619252_10152406485254253:Great no more barbecoa beef burritos for me you just lost my business. Ill just share this with all of my other veteran friends.
124149619252_10152082036279253:nice! So, is the pizza going to be organic, non GMO like Chipotle Mexican Grill ? I hope it doesn't destroy the integrity of Chipotle's products! Cuz it's AMAZING! =D
124149619252_520689341285681:Had this today! It was great. I had to drive 50 miles each way plus pay two bridge tolls but worth it. Please bring this everywhere!!!
124149619252_10152343053104253:Kevin, Easter is a religious holiday and really not the national holiday it has become and really should not be, since church and state are supposed to be separate in this country.  Perhaps working on that day could be optional and on Christmas as well.   Here's another perspective, many employers ask Jewish workers, and, I'm sure members of other religious groups, to work on their most holy days or be fired, also not fair.  What is good for some should be good for all,or at least, optional, yes?
124149619252_10153246130479253:The workers at my local chipotle gave me the impression that it was already an non gmo restaurant, I thought everything was already all natural
124149619252_185864848093833:I can't even read the article!  It'll make me sad!  That is why my husband and I like to eat at chipotle!  Fresh food is wonderful!
124149619252_10151879670959253:PLEASE PLEASE release the official fresh salsa recipe. It's my absolute favorite part of my burrito bowl next to the steak.
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito, a pinch of brown rice, black beans, onions/peppers, barbacoa, cheese, one of the salsas... depends on my mood.
124149619252_492523374093310:Jeeze, this makes me feel better, im not the only addict. I have a chipotle around the corner from my work, and if I coukd Id be there everyday for lunch! Steak burritos and chicken tacos! Yummy :)
124149619252_10152883486474253:Dear chipotle , please tell your workers to stop giving me a baby scoop of chicken in Monroeville. Best wishes, Amber
124149619252_193346814021706:Big Chipotle fan here but that article is no bueno. Tell Joe to delete this immedately and we wish him luck on his new show!
124149619252_10153236016399253:Chipotle serves from steam tables, which is more prone to contamination. Now, they're going to run steam-table food around town on a bike? Oh I forgot, they do this in China, and nobody gets sick in China? Yeah right.
124149619252_10153388589524253:I love chipotle, however I get the bowl due to needing gluten free.  I don't get meat anymore either due to the gristle and large bites of fat.  So far with the veggie I have only had one issue and that was someone not peeling the avocado or removing the pit.
124149619252_10153246130479253:I applaud the change over...I don't eat out at fast food but now at least Chipolte would be safe. Thank you!
124149619252_279121798773401:i usually Get the Buritto Bowl, Cilantro Rice, Black Beans, cheese, Carnita's and Pico de Gallo Salsa and Sour Cram With light Lettuce
124149619252_10153656854824253:Guy tasting the guac: "Can I taste test the guac to see if it's good?"  Manager: "Guac will be extra out of your paycheck, is that fine?"
124149619252_199537401806:Ahahaha! Sucks for all of you asking them to come to your state, when i have one right across the street from my house. California bitches!!
124149619252_10151251776579253:I couldn't love Chipotle more and be a bigger advocate but gee, your new store opening in SF was a mess this week. Restore my faith in chipotle!
124149619252_267832333301923:So... you're buying a $12 lunch bag and a $6 burrito... I'll just walk 3 blocks and go buy the burrito.
124149619252_454413931302356:Megaera la Pict We cancelled our participation in this event, not just due to our policy, but more importantly because it's the right thing to do. - Joe
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl with white rice, both beans, a little lettuce, lots of sour cream, cheese, and just a little corn salsa :-)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Carnitas bowl, rice, pico de gallo, medium salsa, cheese, lettuce, salad dressing, sour cream and chipotle Tabasco..  Yum..
124149619252_10152250518069253:You dont even give free sodas to college students anymore; like we would believe you would give away free food. Ha!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chiken Burrito. Both kinds of rice, pinto beans, mild salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.  Now I want one.
124149619252_10153693560944253:When you all finish trying to grow too fast, spreading ecoli and salmonella, and making your guests wait 30 minutes to get to the counter to actually order because you move at a snails pace....i can fix all of your issues as your next CEO...give me a call...i may know a thing or two about this business :)
124149619252_454413931302356:So WISH I lived near a Chipotle! Thanks for your stand. Donna Willis Hyland, there are a lot of us Christians who are NOT bigoted!!
124149619252_131676086962937:After looking at my badges, I had to click on "All badges" in order to see it. Apparantly my phone was only viewing "Foursquare" badges. If you're not seeing the badge, try that. Also, You have to "like" Chipotle on Foursquare's website first.
124149619252_10151855292469253:Idk if anyone read the rules but you have to be a student at a college they have listed on their entry form.... click on the link above to see!
124149619252_10152406485254253:Chipotle is the only restaurant my kid likes! I love the food, too. now i have anoother reason to love you MORE: SANITY! thank you for making your restaurants safer. MWAH!
124149619252_156053474470:I have thought about how cool it would be to have a Chipotle on the eastern shore of Maryland.  No such luck even though tons of people have sent email requests to get one.  State school and the beach, what else could draw Chipotle there?
124149619252_10153806089609253:Bistroservices provide mobile application (android, IOS) for restaurants, Brand Strategy and building, Content management, Social integration, online ordering menu for restaurants and Customized website. We also offer Marketing services.
124149619252_10152250518069253:U guys suck then. Qdoba had one plus i love qdoba better. Always hated working at the headquarters in downtown denver by speer. Glad i dont go there anymore.
124149619252_454413931302356:Donna, I think you missed Chris's point entirely. Chipotle isn't discriminating against the Boy Scouts. They just choose not to financially support an organization that discriminates against a minority group.
124149619252_10151626575004253:if you roll it thinner and leave one side open you can four more in it and have a manageable size bite..I always get a bowl with a shell on the side because they so often tear the shell or everything falls out in the rolling..
124149619252_10153246130479253:Now how about spreading the ingredients so I don't get one mouthful of rice, the next full of beans, followed by 2 bites of chicken, then a mouthful of sour cream and cheese?  A lil consistency throughout is nice.
124149619252_455264284485429:Quick food that's relatively healthy is hard to find these days.  Keep up the good work.  I don't like to eat out too often because of the chemicals and crap in most fast food.  I don't mind paying a little more for better options.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Really, I was in a Chipotle on Monday and they still serve corn and all test prove that there in no, NON-GMO corn available.  All corn is genetically modified in one way or another.
124149619252_10153405435649253:Delicious. I don't care what my husband says- Chipotle is better than Free Birds any day, and I tell him I am always right.
124149619252_163075200578:Hang tight, everyone. At the moment this promotion is in Arizona, Boston and now Dallas-Fort Worth, but who knows when and where this will be next. Keep the suggestions and feedback coming on our Wall if you like the idea of a Kid's Menu and you'd like it to come to your market. - Colin
124149619252_10152406485254253:Bad food, Bad service, too expensive, charging for guacamole and now banning an entire group of people--- Racist, bigoted -- Never again
124149619252_10153872104594253:Only had burrito once,mostly I'll get the salad with chips never had their taco but since the news came out recently I kinda put a pause on Chipotle awhile maybe,later
124149619252_10151719407409253:How did people find the second ad? I even googled the slogan on the billboard and it doesn't come up.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I tried the sofritas yesterday....and am not impressed. I'll stick with the regular 'vegetarian' bowl. (NormallyI love tofu.)
124149619252_205455487672:Being from Denver and living in London for the past 10 years, this is the best news I've heard in ages. Thanks Chipotle!
124149619252_10151089035244253:My favorite location would be a new one in Hanover, NH!  It's a ripe market with Dartmouth College right here!  (I just moved here and am having withdrawals!)
124149619252_10152990683604253:Have Chipotle started putting garlic in their meat or mild salsa? Because I had a chicken bowl yesterday, and I could taste a little garlic. My body rejects garlic for some reason or another.
124149619252_10152883505569253:I don't fully understand this upon first glance, but I will still like because I tend to like your stuff  lol :)
124149619252_192398874125268:Just seen that your pinto beans are made with a small amount of bacon.  It may be written on the internet but not all vegetarians know this when going into the restaurant and you should have it stated in BOLD what is vegan/vegetarian friendly and what is not in each store.
124149619252_10151089035244253:My favorite locations give free drinks to military. Not so happy with those who dont. Support the troops!!!
124149619252_10152250518069253:aww wittle Dustin got his feelwings hurt.  He taught he was going to get a fwee buwitto, and den Joe hurt his wittle feelwings.
124149619252_10151185000424253:I will not attend. I remember dressing in foil and getting a free one. Boo chipotle. Speak up sheep. Your all sheep
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl veggies brown rice, pinto beans, sour cream, lettuce, cheese and my favorite, guacamole.
124149619252_10153514914799253:Soooo when you gettin pork back?  If you want responsibly raised pork, on a large scale for a restaurant chain, you are probably going to have to do it yourselves......sad truth
124149619252_10153009001449253:My family of six will be back as soon as the pork is! The Carnitas is the main reason I buy Chipotle for my family every weekend.  A lot of loyal customers are trying to be understanding, but are feeling very disappointed.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa or Carnitas with Rice, pinto beans, mild salsa, corn salsa, cheese, sour cream, and just a little lettuce.... mmmmmm.
124149619252_10151719407409253:that was fun, but slightly annoying that i had to re-enter everything  b/c of the submit button being tricky when my laptop screen isn't big enough so i have to keep scrolling with no mouse. blah my fingers hurt.
124149619252_134085872963:I've met Clay before! I used to see him and the guy in the white shirt all the time when I used to go to The Edgeat Kensington on Sunday nights. Congrats man!
124149619252_10151024826814253:bowl, brown rice, black beans, fajita mix, chicken, everything else except guac. My people know my order , I don't even have to tell them anymore.  :) same for wife.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl: brown rice, black beans, chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, cheese & lettuce. Hope you guys figure out a way to make some yummy desserts (like cinnamon chips, sopapillas... Something?!)
124149619252_10152250518069253:The post should b from u joe a free lunch every once in a while is a nice way to let all of us well paying customers no that u appreciate all of us making u the $$ to by thos fancy looking drinks and food in your pics.
124149619252_10152786808474253:I have been asking for Chipotle in Maine for years..  You are here!  Only 18 miles from our house......thank you.
124149619252_167132760066216:Hey everybody, just a reminder for this that your amazing haiku must be posted on our FB wall to qualify. - Joe
124149619252_10151024826814253:Oh glad you asked. Bowl to go, white rice, extra rice, no beans, no wait no I SAID NO BEANS, No, no beans, ok steak. NO NOT CHICKEN, steak, yeah. Actually no that steak wasn't cooked well again, so barbacoa. Cheese. Extra cheese. Side of mild hot sour cream. No not all together. Chips. No I don't charge me for chips and salsa, those salsas are for the bowl not the chips. Yes to go. Water cup.
124149619252_379758315393214:Keep programs like this going year round chipotle. Finally you will realize the benefit of a customer appreciation program. Buy 4 get 1 free... And yall get the money upfront
124149619252_10152786808474253:Carnitas burrito, brown rice, pinto beans, pico and the hot salsa, cheese and sour cream , guacamole and lettuce!
124149619252_10153200118729253:Cheap dates are perfect first dates. Unless you are really into someone and it's a special occasion it shouldn't be fancy and if a girl expects that she isn't worth your time anyway.
124149619252_10151486609219253:No burrito for me....had to have lunch elsewhere because there's no Chipolte close to me...Livonia/ Novi, Mi :( Wish there was one here!!
124149619252_10153423452749253:Rachel Klein will you go to this with me? I love Atlas Genius and your fav band (Hippo Campus) will be there
124149619252_10153045128369253:What Chipotle is that because the ones here don't look that good lol but they taste good just don't look good
124149619252_10153395310879253:All these people saying they won't eat at chipotle again. THANK YOU!!! NO MORE LONG LINES!!!! #LOVEWINS
124149619252_322643590240:Went to order delivery and they wanted $5.  umm I may want that one day but not TODAY!!  Love it but that is a bit steep!
124149619252_10153302438484253:No doubt and this is why I love chipotle there vision an there goals elevate me to be proud of working  for this company
124149619252_10153389325099253:Chipotle is closed in the east coast. I don't want to see these sponsored ads during closed hours, defeats the purpose.
124149619252_10153514914799253:Girl: am I pretty? Boy: no Girl: do you even want to be with me forever? Boy: no Girl: do you even like me?

124149619252_10153170449024253:There's things on the cups too?! I always bring a water bottle because I pay the extra money for guac. This almost makes me want to get a drink next time
124149619252_192398874125268:They have a wannabe Chipotle here in the UK. We're currently stationed here for a few years. It's called Barburrito and it's NASTY!
124149619252_10153166302899253:I had the sofritos the free day when they had a come back and get one on us after special; NEVER AGAIN.
124149619252_10152406485254253:Was eating there twice a day for my paleo diet that was working very well for me too.......kinda sucks but ill feel better giving my business elsewhere
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl: brown rice, pinto beans, barbacoa, mild salsa, corn, cheese, and lettuce. Sour creme on the side. Water cup. Always. 
124149619252_10153071221514253:The only response I get when I ask for guac is "you know that's extra, right?" YES I KNOW IT'S EXTRA! I DON'T NEED YOU TO MAKE FINANCIAL DECISIONS FOR ME!
124149619252_454413931302356:I was a Boy Scout, and my sons were Boy Scouts. The Boy Scouts of America is a tremendously positive organization and I am fed up with the gay political machine running over and destroying everything positive in America. STOP RAMMING YOUR POLITICS DOWN OUR THROATS!!!  Chipotle Mexican Grill, I do not understand why you would want to politicize your restaurant...makes no sense to me. I mistakenly believed that you were about selling great Mex food to Mex food lovers...I had no idea that you were also a part of the gay agenda political lobby. Now that you have made me aware that you are a political group, you can count me and my family out as customers. Thank you for publicly admitting your hidden political agenda so that we are now aware! Should you realize the error of your ways , get out of politics, go back to just selling great food and choose to once again support the Boy Scouts, I will gladly be your customer and tell all my friends and family as well!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Yes. There is such thing as a free lunch , and I have had a free burrito many times at chipotle so why do u sound so rude , Joe ?
124149619252_228303190552746:There is not enough chipotle restaurants in town so I had to eat another restaurants burrito. It was cruel. 
124149619252_182078509223:Tracy good point. Us meat eaters don't have to eat it and it's a good business move to draw in more people.   Mathew I tried to get Chipotle for my Bro in Iraq. No dice but i do have a hand of free burrito coupons for him for when he comes home. They sent them to me for him in thanks for his service.
124149619252_164816057005566:Honesty Morgan- Our vegetarian items include guacamole in their price, and our guac costs about as much as our meats for us to prepare and serve. Hence the pricing. I hope that makes sense. - Joe
124149619252_10153246130479253:are you serving anything with corn product in it? then you're selling GMO, humans have been doing this stuff for millennia, where do you think the banana came from?
124149619252_10153009001449253:Yeah, i tried tofu on accident once at a salad bar and i have to say, that's where i draw the line. ????
124149619252_10151839071994253:chipotle US - LIKE Price ~7$ OK  chipotle UK - LIKE Price ~7£ OK  chipotle Germany - LIKE Price 9 !!!!!!! NOT OK Cornelia, Yvonne
124149619252_10152261058584253:That doesn't sound fair :( tomorrow is my birthday and I'm all the way in Albuquereque, NM <3 Chipotle Mexican Grill <3
124149619252_10153246130479253:I wish more fast food companies were this transparent https://chipotle.com/ingredient-statement. For the people who say I didn't know they used them, can anyone find a restaurant chain that doesn't use GMO'S? I still see lines and lines out of Starbucks. Did you know there baked goods, pre-made food and milk are all GMO? Plus, there GMO milk has the added rBGH, rBGH is another genetically modified product.  http://www.ejnet.org/bgh/nogood.html
124149619252_202478973111117:Just got my gold-wrapped deliciousness and am thoroughly loving as we speak!  Congrats on all the milestones, Chipotle!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thank you Chipotle Mexican Grill for your contribution to educating the public on GMO's. Very exciting to see positive change!! The food industry has lots more work to do but it's worth it for better health and protecting our planet. TY!.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Wow. The pattern I see is people on either side of the argument who dwell on information that supports their belief. In this age of sound bites, memes, and snappy comebacks you have to WANT to find out you are wrong and put some quality effort to do so. http://www.boulderweekly.com/article-12640-muzzled-by-monsanto.html
124149619252_10153246130479253:No you haven't. As NPR pointed out tonight, you would also have to have organic meat as well. This is a fool's errand and I will eat less at Chipotle.
124149619252_127768177287696:Chipotle closed at 5 tonight for a f**king Christmas party. I drove 5 miles for nothing. Then there was an accident on the road on the way home and I had to detour. An hour later I picked up something else for dinner. Thanks Chipotle.
124149619252_135356053201187:I just had Chipotle, and I will have it again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again
124149619252_10153009001449253:I thought about it and.... Yeah no thanks I love my beef to much!! Wouldn't do it even for the free burrito. And BELIEVE me I love me some FREE chipotle lol.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Obviously.. lol Chipotle NEVER gives anything for free or has any promotions or bogo's, of course it was a hoax.
124149619252_10153112208029253:I've been craving crispy tacos!! How did you know Saigon?! I go to work next week so I'll have some money in my pocket finally!!! 5 months of no work is freaking depressing!
124149619252_10150959152619253:I made a special trip with 5 National Champion Dancers to this terminal just to get breakfast burritos. :)

124149619252_10152004082504253:Burnsville, MN locations is too busy so can't ever go to chipotle anymore.  The app is nice but not if my order isn't ever ready.
124149619252_10150719072154253:Thanks for being closed on Easter, which is the day we celebrate the resurrection of our Lord & Savior!  We celebrate the resurrection every Sunday and it would be awesome if you would honor that every Sunday!  Chick-fil-A does it and they are doing just fine!  Something to think about!
124149619252_10152250518069253:My heart just broke into pieces Rosa Vicioso ... Why do they play with my feelings like that? Whyyyyy? :'(
124149619252_10151053134024253:I had been out of the country for a month, and my family came to visit me in Venice. They brought a burrito when they came over from Ohio. I ate it on the Rialto Bridge.
124149619252_180887498696:My brief understanding is that Chipotle was started in denver.  Along the way Mc D. bought a majority share for a few years.  Now McDonalds has sold all the shares it held.  If you want to conspiracy theory it then go ahead but Chipotle does not = McDonalds.
124149619252_10153693560944253:Hmmmmm...you announce that you are going GMO-free to an uproar and then, Wow!!!, you have the CDC down your throat for E coli.   Gee. There's no correlation, right?
124149619252_10151024826814253:On my burrito!  Extra rice, pinto, chicken, lettuce, hot and mild, cheese, extra sour cream, sometimes guac.
124149619252_10153624802079253:I want to chime in and say that I admire the forward thinking that Chipotle displayed during this trial. Thank you for taking swift action to ensure your brand maintains its integrity by doing the right thing. As director of operations for a strong NW brand, your caution is respected and your honesty admired. Thank you for making the tough decisions to keep the public safe.
124149619252_10152250518069253:I'd like to just say that if a multi-million dollar corporation can't honor one free meal to a new customer even if it is a hoax that's ridiculous there are people who are probably going to Chipotle for the first time because of that and they're getting turned away and may never go back to your business again because of it I am one of those people so thanks for losing my business because you can't afford one free meal out of the billions of dollars you make everyday
124149619252_10153009001449253:I've had the sofritas already, it was good and spicy, but I will gladly take Chipotle up on the free offer!
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken bowl with extra rice, mild salsa cheese and sour cream, and guac.....and tabasco as well! mmmmmmm
124149619252_10152250518069253:a lot of eateries totally do free some food or drink item day tho... something's don't cost cash upfront
124149619252_205082546217004:I think it depends on what you order to make it healthy. If you get a burrito with everything in it then no its not very healthy. but if you get a bowl with veggies and chicken i think it can be healthy for an "eating out meal". its better than most fast food places. But I think the healthest you can get is if you cook at home with fresh veggies and other fresh food.
124149619252_10152407734029253:Loved the baby sized burrito...wish you would thinks things through before stating them publicly. Now you have this mess. The folks who follow you're rule are the customers you want, the one's that don't are there to rob you. Good luck.
124149619252_10152262999499253:Come to Ohio!!! Specifically Columbus! I do know where I'm eating on vacation this summer in NY! Thanks for being friendly to vegans!
124149619252_10152445209089253:something horribly wrong with the words "tea party" and "truth" in the same sentence without a "not" in it.
124149619252_10153806089609253:I love love love Chipotle... not eating there right now but once the situation gets handle, I'll be back!
124149619252_156053474470:Either I can walk five minutes off campus to Chipotle or I can call and wait twenty minutes for my chipotle . . . I'll walk
124149619252_202478973111117:Daniel @taylor is a troll. Happy anniversary Chipotle... "For an Unlimited time only?" Are you switching to gold for good?
124149619252_10150987384894253:I had over 60 check-ins (once a day) during the promotion period and I'm not even a runner-up? This is crap. :(
124149619252_10150987384894253:No winners in North Carolina?! I looooooove chipotle!!!! When it first opened in Winston like 6 years ago, I ate it everyday for a year! I still have to have it every week or 2! Everything is soo flavorful and delicious! There is simply no burrito that even comes close!!! Love the guacamole and chips too!! My 15 month old loves it too!!! <3
124149619252_10153001213604253:Thank you, Chipotle, for supporting the humane treatment of pigs. And for offering really, really tasty veg food. Yum!
124149619252_10153246130479253:To all the haters, Chipotle is not charging more for their GMO free food, they are just providing a product that is less likely to cause Chron's autism, leaky bowel and Parkinson's to name a few.
124149619252_10153693560944253:Wish food allergens were taken seriously. My daughter is highly allergic to dairy. I asked for fresh guacamole tonight since the one on the line was covered in cheese. I got a response of "guacamole doesn't have dairy in it." I was handed a bowl with a cheese on it.  Edited to add: I have a picture, but it seems your site is set up so I can't add one.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Why don't you use Beyond Meat? Soy is not always GMO free, and many can't eat it because of the high plant estrogens in soy. http://beyondmeat.com
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito, sour cream is amazing. Build a chipotle in Northern Westchester County, New York please. The closest one is 45 minutes away.
124149619252_10152560126959253:Chipolte is being sued by Janeka Samuels a former Black employee in the City of San Luis Obispo. She is suing over allegations of racial discrimination by her former supervisor Ben DeBilzan that is supported by other employees and their statements.    I have looked for an official statement from the Chipolte Corporate people telling us that 'the claims are not true and they look forward to be exonerated in court'.  Haven't found anything other than Chipolte Denver-based attorney Charles Cavanagh entering a general denial in response to the claims in Samuels lawsuit. That's like a person holding a half eaten donut and claiming they don't know who ate it!! Check out New Times San Luis Obispo July 17-July 24, 2014 edition. www.newtimesslo.com  Sadly I must say adieu to my favorite Chipolte 'bowl' until the truth comes out about whether Chipolte corporate turned a 'blind eye' in a predominately white college town that I dearly love :-(
124149619252_10152805746454253:Best chipotle in carle place. But unfortunately your farmingdale location is very bad. You have a lot of rude employees
124149619252_159372559415:My kids have always loved Chipotle! We don't have kids meals in Cleveland but they handle the bowls just fine! They must take after their father!!
124149619252_10151203785419253:What is sad it my local knows me so well...They have my crisoy chicken tacos almost done before i GET TO THE BEGINNING OF THE LINE...LOL
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie bowl with brown rice, black beans, fajita veggies, hot salsa, sour cream, guac and extra cheese with tortilla on the side. Do I get free chipotle now? :)
124149619252_10153792851004253:I'm pregnant so am too afraid to eat at Chipotle. Don't want to risk the baby. Hope you can figure out what the source is and how to stop it once and for all. I am craving a bowl SO badly!
124149619252_10150262089049253:i work at chipotle in san luis obispo california and love the fact that we take so much pride in our food...
124149619252_10151089035244253:I hate the architecture and design at the KY and OH locations. There's so much metal which gives it a very cold feeling and it's just so uncomfortable. The design in this picture is nicer than the ones here. I guess it does't matter too much though because the food is amazing so I'll keep going back!
124149619252_10151089035244253:My favorite location WOULD BE Reno, NV, But there's still no Chipolte out here!!!  How Could you deprive the Reno-Tahoe community of such mouth watering, meaty, hot, fresh and god like burritos???!!! But, since there isn't one out here, my next favorite location would have to be the Roseville, CA location across from the galleria. Its like a pilgrimage every time to enjoy the savory burritos as it is clenched between my two hands in almost a spiritual fashion!!
124149619252_100913656591677:I gurentee the best Chipotle Mexican Grill is right there in Downtown DENVER, COLORADO  where it was originally made!!!!!
124149619252_228034027252006:I miss the good old days when you could go in with a tinfoil hat and get a free burrito. That was heavenly
124149619252_10151037650024253:WoAh, wait, what this chipotle vinaigrette dressing? Am going to have to get a sample when we're near our chipotle in a week....:) 
124149619252_10153240834269253:Sorry Chipotle, even going GMO free I still will never eat your food again. I'm still grossed out by the horrid painful episode of food poisoning i received after eating a burrito from your store which held me captive to my bathroom floor for 6 hours...my body even ran out of bile to vomit.
124149619252_10152407734029253:My money goes to businesses who care about what's rightz and about the safetyz of your patrons, and disarmingz does not create a safez environment and instead creates a forcedz victimisationz zone. (The filter is set so extremely high that I had to purposefully misspell most of that)
124149619252_192398874125268:Kelly- ask for a kids taco, burrito. We get that and mine gobble it up. Comes like a cute kids meal on their own tray.
124149619252_10152250518069253:People!  Clearly someone hacked images and created a fake add!  Chipotle Mexican Grill ROCKS!  If you owned a company, would you put out a coupon worth $7ish for a FREE burrito to millions or billions of people!?!  Get a clue!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Fajita chicken bowl, white cilantro rice, no beans, lots of onions/peppers, corn and medium salsa, with a glob of sour cream on the side of the bowl. YUM!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Love the sofritas, but unfortunately the O'Fallon Missouri location was out when we went.  They were obviously not prepared for this promotion.
124149619252_256556984380282:Thats right. Chipotle needs a drive thru. It will be fast. Usually at lunch it takes me 10 minutes to order because it's really busy. 
124149619252_10152406485254253:yeah hi, i couldnt help but read one of your togo bags quotes at 0:48 '' Hope that, in the future,all is well,EVERYONE EATS FREE,no one must work,all just sit around feeling love for one another" i must say i didnt know how charitable chipotle was until now. i'll be expecting my promo code for a free burrito soon.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito bowl, brown rice, black beans, fajita, pico, corn, cheese and lettuce.  Scrumptious!!!  Love it even more when the steak is a lovely medium rare.
124149619252_10152323527922741:If you really believe that organic, free range, antibiotic free meat is the way to go, I will not tell you that you shouldn't eat that way. But I disagree.   Tell the starving people around the world that we have the means to produce enough food for them, but we don't do it because it's mean to do that to the animals.  Come see my 2500 hog facility where we use terrible antibiotics (that are closely monitored to make sure they are digested and inactive before the pigs are slaughtered) and use those terrible confinement buildings (that have been 65 degrees with no snow all winter and water and food is always accessible). I'd welcome anyone to come see it anytime, I have nothing to hide.  Chipotle can brag about their food with integrity but that's really bragging about their lack of understanding.
124149619252_10152250518069253:There is such a thing as a free lunch.  You can offer a loyalty program like Qdoba, starbucks, red robin, and more, you can get more business.  Thank you.  I also agree that Joe's messages was poorly worded to the consumers.  How about you be nicer to the customers that help keep Chipotle running?
124149619252_10151024826814253:Carnitas! It doesn't matter if it's tacos or a burrito, I have it the same way, with vegies, carnitas, mild salsa, guacamole and lettuce. It doesn't even matter that guac costs extra. It's worth it!
124149619252_10150719072154253:@Joseph Tamargo uuummm catholics aren't the only ones who celebrate Easter.. Wow that was one of the dumbest comments I've ever read.. Congrats
124149619252_10153246130479253:When we eat out chipotle will be our go to place! Thank you for making this incredible change!!! I will be a loyal patron from this day forward!!!!! We do t eat out because of this problem but now we have somewhere to go!!! You rock chipotle and I will spread the word!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Awesome deal,  Only the one in slc(sugarhouse) ran out of SOFRITAS,  by 3pm.  I couldn't get one. :-(
124149619252_10151053134024253:The day I ate at my 1st and 100th different Chipotle location were my most memorable to date. The journey continues....
124149619252_10151486609219253:Flour tortilla, white rice, black beans, carnitas, pico, red hot sauce, corn, sour cream, cheese, lettuce & guac please!
124149619252_10151089035244253:The original in Denver. I live less than 10 minutes away from it. It's the only one still not owned by McDonalds.
124149619252_10151192106409253:couple years ago it was totally free if you wore any kind of alumuminum. Im gonna still go because a 2 dollar burrito is still a big deal! but whats wrong with it being free? especially for the people who are faithful
124149619252_147322035888:Great video! I actually heard of Denton, TX for the first time ever on yesterday!! Now Shane has put it on the map.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl- brown rice, bl beans, med salsa, corn salsa, light sour cream, guac, cheese and lettuce - YUM!!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:VEGGIE BOWL: brown rice, black beans, sometimes fajita peppers, extra tomatoes (fresh salsa), corn, medium salsa, guacamole, sometimes lettuce, sometimes cheese (trying to go dairy-free and meat-free). Yum!
124149619252_10153009001449253:I have a question Chipotle Mexican Grill ... Can you still get this offer if you purchase a half and half sofritas and another meat in your burrito???
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak or chicken burrito, white rice, black beans, fresh tomato salsa, EXTRA cilantro, sour cream cheese and we can't forget a squirt of lemon and chipotle SMOKED Tabasco sauce on every bite!  Mmmm now im hungry ...
124149619252_10153246130479253:Whenever I have a choice, I'll choose to eat at Chipotle from now on. Thank you for giving us this option.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Dumbest thing ever, people who think GMO food are bad are probably the same ones who don't believe in vaccines or climate change...every single thing has been modified...people need to open their minds...

124149619252_10151089035244253:Probably the beach, or Dodger Stadium, or the disc golf course, or my gf's couch lol!  That's more than one tho, my bad lol!
124149619252_10151089035244253:The new 5th Avenue store in St. Cloud.  Nice re-use of an historic building central to the town's history. Nice outside space to people watch, and a nice fresh look inside.
124149619252_190952584702:Chicken burrito with black beans, rice, green sauce, lettuce, cheese, and a bag o chips....in case anyone wants to surprise me sometime :o)
124149619252_10153389325099253:i don't have a snapchat, but you should know i eat Chipotle in Boardman, OH, where they are the friendliest people ever!  somebody at the top should give them all a little bonus. ;)
124149619252_10153383922329253:Sophia Delgadillo Ruben Him Ruvalcaba vamos? Va a estar Portugal the man, es buen grupo y de a grapa ????
124149619252_205082546217004:I soooooooo wish we had a Chipotle in Huntsville, Alabama!  We are an affluent town with lots of successful restaurants and retail stores, two universities and several smaller colleges.  A Chipotle would do very well here!  Come to Huntsville!  Pretty please?
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito, extra brown rice, both beans, double steak, extra corn, extra hot, light sour, cheese and lettuce. Thank you. I won't tell anyone about the 4.5 lb burrito though. 
124149619252_10153246130479253:Show me the science that GMOs are harmful. Your choice is fine with me, but  understand that I choose not to eat at Chipotle because your position on GMOs. Win-win.
124149619252_199537401806:The most logical place would be Louisiana. They have the highest population by far then any other state remaining you've yet to open up in.
124149619252_10152261058584253:There's no such thing as "a free burrito" but there is a such thing as 28 free burritos. If it's 28 a day then it's 140 free burritos.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Hat's off to a chain like Chipotle to take the lead and keep the discussion going about what is put in our food.
124149619252_199537401806:you need to inform the west! wyoming, montana, south dakota...they have no idea what chipotle is! its devistating!
124149619252_10152388726009253:Beautiful sight.   Have one growing on my front porch. ...shame it will never be bigger than what it is now since I live in Texas.
124149619252_10152406485254253:You guys did not learn your lesson from recent events... terrible business move and judging from the latest post on your fb... well I think your business might experience some serious shrinkage.... yikes!
124149619252_10152406485254253:I was very happy that Chipotle was getting away from GMO's, however, now that they have given in to the civilian disarmament psychos, I can no longer do business with them in good conscience.
124149619252_10152250518069253:I still think chipotle should have a frequent flyer card....but 10 get one free!  We are there ALL.THE.TIME! Lol

124149619252_10152560126959253:I am that gluten free jerk in the line.  Crispy tacos, wipe down the line and change your gloves!  Sorry about that everyone!
124149619252_10153310575624253:James Wooten will you be there? I saw smallpools, idk if you're still running around with them anymore
124149619252_205082546217004:Congrats, Chipotle!!! and Congrats to all the other winners in this survey....almost all winners in each category are faves of mine, too! But my BIG winner fave is always...CHIPOTLE!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Nowadays, its a Barbacoa bowl w/ white rice, pinto beans, mild salsa (pico), cheese, and sour cream.  REQUIRED side would be a large cheese quesadilla.  If I can't get the quesadilla, then all the above goes into a burrito!  It's sad to know there's no chipotles anywhere near Pensacola.... :'(
124149619252_10153009001449253:Sofritas-555 milligrams Carnitas-550 Barbacoa- 530 Horrible amount of sodium.  Compared to  Steak-320 Chicken-310
124149619252_156053474470:we had something similar at the Air Force Academy, they tacked on like a 3 dollar delivery fee and we got our Chipotle warm, a delicacy indeed. it's also great that chipotleaway was invented. ;p
124149619252_10153449274069253:Checkout AWESOME fan photos from the festival! http://www.crowdalbum.com/album/55aa08096170707e7200019d/Chipotle-Cultivate-Festival-Kansas-City_20150718
124149619252_10151999836584253:I'm 22 weeks pregnant and my baby is made out of Chipotle tacos- that is the only thing I ever want to eat.  Thank goodness for the app, because my southside Chicago Chipotle has a 45 minute wait if you come in and stand in line.
124149619252_279121798773401:yea ya know chipotle burritos vary considerably depending on the location you get them from..........
124149619252_156053474470:WTF??  I can't even get a location opened up here and you fuckers are getting the shit deliivered, do I move?
124149619252_10152262999499253:Tofu is not my thing....but if that's what it takes to get you to open in Auburn NY....I guess its what's for dinner.
124149619252_109031815838831:I never really noticed that Chipotle was advertised mostly via word of mouth, but now that I think about it... I've heard a Chipotle ad on the radio once, maybe twice. But someone recommended Chipotle to me once and we had lunch there. Then, since of course I loved it, I started recommending it to people. That's got to be the most ancient and effective form of advertising. You have to be really awesome to advertise by that method.
124149619252_10153872104594253:Wheres my coupon Chipotle Mexican Grill I fille dout the form the text had sent me, but still no coupon has been sent...

124149619252_10152250518069253:I should give Qdoba the idea... There may not be such a thing as free lunch at Chipotle... But at Qdoba LOL!!!!
124149619252_105860719543628:chipotle gietting toooo expensive.....and they dont put enough barbacoa in dem tacos too be costing so high
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito, brown rice, no bean, double steak, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and the salad dressing pored all over it
124149619252_205455487672:I think you should quit effing around and bring your vegan mock chickeny goodness to San Francisco already.
124149619252_10153204555039253:Vincent Conanan Elaina Renee Jasmine Mayate Vanessa Caballero we are already going to be there...what about going early 4 this ??

124149619252_10150942028479253:I always get weird looks from you Chipotle employees when I ask for all three.  They each have good flavor!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Don't listen to all the haters out there that are calling your decision based on pseudo science...they are all probably being paid off by Monsanto.  Way to take a stand! Your new forever faithful non-GMO supporting customer. ????
124149619252_10153135670549253:Take a moment to reflect on the joy of discovering Lewis center OH Chipotle finally got in Carnitas after a loooong absence!!  The heavens have parted!
124149619252_10153878506969253:Those of you that understand why Chipotle went gmo will want to help your family and friends understand why this company went no gmo.  Here is the documentary that blew the lid off of Monsanto's poison food. Genetic Roulette:  The Gamble of Our Lives 10 minute trailer:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB5EBFUwaw0 free on you tube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB5EBFUwaw0 film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-WUsaASEkc

124149619252_10153246130479253:When they stop serving dead animals itll really be cause to celebrate. Ill never understand how my species cares more about how "healthy" or "clean" something is, than the cruelty in the nature of slaughter
124149619252_10152322736529253:you guys should have a SUPER HOT night where you have a super spicy salsa available. made with like ghost peppers and other super hot  peppers.
124149619252_10150163731434253:Choptle has become one of my favorite places to eat!! Love my chicken burrito!! Had one today in fact! ;)
124149619252_10151719407409253:They don't post the winners for dailies... They notify you via phone or email. Which is why you need a valid email address.
124149619252_205455487672:come to duluth minnesota before you go across the pond!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
124149619252_10152557454524253:Oh no! Gay people eat at Chipotle?! Get over yourself, James! There is nothing wrong with gay people or a business supporting them. Why did you even feel the need to comment? Don't answer that... It's rhetorical...and no one cares. I'll pray for you.
124149619252_156053474470:wait a minute? you say you deliver in columbus ohio?! why, that is awesome! i'm in columbus! bring a bottle of green sauce with mine!

124149619252_10153246130479253:Why I like the idea of this I am not in love with the new Chipotle taste. I miss getting my burritos on broadway in denver when they were massive and were so good. Now the only difference between you and your competitor is steak flavor and quac flavor
124149619252_10152406485254253:Just don't buy the gift cards.  You and your bank will be forced into a relationship with Chipotle that you do not need.
124149619252_10153246130479253:How about stop raising food prices? We're all gonna die anyhow. I'd prefer to enjoy my food while I'm here.
124149619252_10153405438314253:Chipotle owners and store designers have you thought about having at least 2 registers in the store to check folks out? The lines in your stores are ridiculously long.  You should think about this with future store designs....
124149619252_213189592025031:18 years old=no real life experience. This is the problem with government run schools is that at 18 years old kids are drinking the Lefty Kool-Aid!  "skulls full of mush", quoting a great American
124149619252_10153112208029253:Let's open this in the Conyers, Covington, Decatur, Lithonia, Stone Mountain area. That's Georgia baby.
124149619252_10152560126959253:Mine wasn't listed  :( chicken bowl with half and half rice, black beans, sour cream, cheese and lettuce. Pico on the side!
124149619252_10152715839394253:Burrito, little rice, pintos, steak, mild, little green, EXTRA hot, corn, sour cream, cheese, guac and lettuce!  Oh ya and a bowl to place it in cuz it is too sloppy to be rolled good!  ;-)
124149619252_10153569576059253:Cavemen ate chicken raw also. I ordered chicken at chipotle once and it was raw. Went back with my normal steak bowl after that! I love chipotle but I will never order chicken again...
124149619252_10151024826814253:I have led many to the Great Chipotle. And I give the same disclaimer every time: "I am NOT responsible, from this day forward, for random obessed thoughts of how bad you wish Chipotle was open so you could have it..AGAIN..for the 3ed time..this week.."
124149619252_10152949800154253:We're sorry, Jason. But we hope that maybe our official statement on this will help a bit: http://chip.tl/NYPDStatement -Joe
124149619252_10151185000424253:Hasn't been free in a few years. I think it just got to be too popular. I won't complain about $2 Chipotle - still a great deal!!
124149619252_10152408378957741:Interesting, until the article claims, "...moved back to Boulder and there opened the first restaurant. " That weak journalism spin was to cater to the idea that Boulder is grassroots, which serves no purpose to anyone that doesn't live in Boulder. Chipotle is still my favorite, the author is not.
124149619252_10151486609219253:White rice, chicken, pinto beans, light salsa, extra lettuce, and sour cream. ;9 And some of that amazing dressing on the side.
124149619252_10151024826814253:A bowl with extra extra white rice , half chicken , half steak , corn , a lot of cheese and light lettuce - with chips and green salsa! yuuuummmm!!!
124149619252_10151316869709253:Good for u. Family values and employee consideration are important especially around the holidays. We can wait.  More businesses should follow u and chic fil a's lead.
124149619252_10152883478794253:Blue lives matter!!!! Such a disgrace what the employees did at that store!!! Will never eat at your restaurants in any city ever again!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:MMMMMmmmm I'm salivating already: salad, rice, chicken, fajita veggies, corn, tomato salsa, sour cream, cheese, and the vinaigrette. Oh, yum, the vinaigrette!!! That makes or breaks this salad. The mixer at my local Chipotle was broken one week, so they didn't have any vinaigrette made. I was devastated, and my salad wasn't the same!
124149619252_10151611917404253:We have one on every corner in L.A...haahahaha, just kiddin but they seem to be opening more and more every time. Soon I will have one within walking distance it is going to be awesome! Who cares, right?
124149619252_160584150738666:Come to whichita falls texas!!! Theres an air force base here and these airman will eat this stuff up!! All we have is a quedobas (sp?) And they are ok but nothing beats chipotle!!! O how i miss thee!!!
124149619252_166838126748689:I love chipotle I ate it every other week when I was pregnant with my son. I still eat it, mine goes like this rice, black beans, grilled veggies, 1/2 chicken, 1/2 steak, corn, fresh, xtra sour cream and xtra cheese.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Chipotle has gone non-GMO. Nothing like celebrating eating healthy by eating a bunch of greasy Mexican food loaded with cheese, beef, sauce, guacamole, and sour cream. So lets see, 611,105 deaths in the US in 2013 from heart disease and 0 deaths or even hospitalizations from GMOs; sounds logical.  I mean even Big Mac is only 530 calories. At Chipotle, a single burrito with one meat and one filling is up to 1580 calories and thats without a side or a drink. Add chips with guacamole and a drink and you are up to 2620. You'll have a heart attack before you leave the restaurant; but hey, at least there aren't any GMOs in there, right?  The chips and the drinks still have high fructose corn syrup in them and thats GMO.  Also, the rennet used to make the cheese is vegetable rennet which means it comes from genetically modified yeast.
124149619252_10151486609219253:Brown and white rice...fried peppers and onions...black beans...double meat chicken and steak...lettuce, pico, two scoops of medium sauce, one of hot...love...
124149619252_10151089035244253:Arlington, TX, South Cooper location. Their chicken is always perfectly seasoned and everyone is great!
124149619252_10151024826814253:hard shell chicken tacos, extra chicken sometimes lol white rice,no beans, no corn, hot salsa, sour cream,lots of cheese and  lettuce .. Nice and simple (:  - Now can we get a free one for answering lbdas
124149619252_10153009001449253:Thanks Chipotle Mexican Grill even though you ran out you honored the promotion and my next burrito is on you.
124149619252_10152307671269253:so I wonder since my name is dexter and the wrote laboratory on it how much trouble do you think you will get into?
124149619252_10152236327209253:Tiffany Vaughn - GS cookies aren't GMO Free?  Are you kidding me?  Next you're going to tell me that Oreos and Hot Pockets are dangerous to my health.  What is this world coming to?  Seriously.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl with white rice, black beans, double steak, medium salsa, cheese, and lettuce. I get Chipotle a few times a week. Totally a complete addict! <3
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chipotle, your food has helped me get swole by dirty bulking and ripped sikkunt by cutting. I love it every way. Just sayin.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Oh yeah, I love this offer, I will check with Dan, he has been to Chipotle so he knows where it is. :-D That will be our Jan. 26 dinner!!
124149619252_10152786808474253:I wish they were more mixed like this pic. I always get a bite of rice or sour cream or lettuce, then somewhere along the way your delish carnitas <<yumm!! I now started getting a burrito bowl with tortilla on the side, mix it up and stuff my own. :( 
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veg bowl---white rice, extra black beans, fajita veg, tomato salsa, extra green tomatillo salso, cheese an lettuce.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl w/ white rice, pinto beans, half steak & half barbacoa, sour cream, & cheese doused in chipotle pepper sauce. :)
124149619252_454413931302356:I've never been to Chipotle, but you can believe me and my wallet are going to go there now. Yay Chipotle!!!
124149619252_157777224183:wroking at chipotle has its benefits. For all you CC runners out there a bit of advice: Dont eat a huge burrito before running. It doesnt work out well in the end (past experience haha)
124149619252_10153246130479253:Inspire others through what you create and lead by example. Sometimes the best thing the world needs is a new interpretation and making that voice louder is what we do.   Www.emelodyproductdevelopment.com

124149619252_454413931302356:Chipotle is deleting most of the opposing comments. Lets see how long it takes before they delete this one.
124149619252_10152314382492741:Don't try it in Michigan. Just ask Baker's Green Acres.  He is being fined  $700000 for daring to raise a heritage breed of pig outdoors on his farm.

124149619252_10153340494079253:There have been times that I've wanted a burrito so badly I drove 90 minutes to get a proper one from Chipotle.
124149619252_279121798773401:I used to love the food there. I got some tonight for dinner and its just nasty. The food was better when they the real people making. Now you can taste the difference
124149619252_10151024826814253:I get the same thing every time:  Burrito - half the 'normal' amount of white rice; pinto beans; double Barbacoa; a little bit of mild; plenty of cheese; a little sour cream.  Large unsweet iced tea. Three times a week without fail.  Yummy!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Great work Chipotle! http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/roundup-ingredient-probably-carcinogenic-humans/
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito/extra brown rice/black beans/extra mild salsa/extra cheese/little lettuce/guac on the side = the secret to eternal life.
124149619252_182409608462105:hire any Illegal Aliens this week? thought I'd ask ,know how much Chipotles likes undocumented workers thats why I don;t go and never will.
124149619252_100780796665922:I absolutelyLOVE chipotle and I go there almost every week.  But, Qboda's chicken is SO much better.  Chipotles is fatty and is almost always cold.  Qdoba also has queso that is amazing.  Chipotle's hot salsa is the best though and that is the reason I go there and Qdoba's does't compare.  Chipotle needs to work on their chicken though.
124149619252_10153246130479253:I thought nothing was GMO in then first place? There's always raging about how amazing their products are...
124149619252_10153009001449253:You guys suck, As a vegetarian I was so looking forward to this, only to call every store in the area and find out they ran out too quickly. What a failed promotion.
124149619252_100780796665922:i'll take qdoba when chipotle further away, i'll suffer like that for some mexican food. but this article is comparing a taco salad to a burrito bowl. of course the burrito bowl would win.
124149619252_454413931302356:Both sides in this disagreement seem to take 1 point and blow it out of proportion. Here is my problem wuth Chipotle 1) the coupons have been given/issued to Scouts 2)The BSA policy is long standing and Chipotle has sponsoered before, therefor they should fulfill their stated obligation instead of ruining things for the scouts (WHO HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE POLICY) and not support in the future if they choose  My problem with with the opponents of the policy change, especially in this string 1)Nambla is such a small portion of the population its ludacris to think of it as an issue. especially with each BSA leader getting background checked 2) The hateful language is just over the top
124149619252_10153246130479253:All we ask is that GMO's be labeled and guaranteed not to cross contaminate organic crops. If you can't do that then they should be banned.
124149619252_10153806089609253:If you don't like it, then don't eat it. Don't bash Chipotle because they had an unfortunate outbreak of food borne Illness. It has happened to many chains.  The only good reason to bash is for bad service.  #chipotle I still love your food!
124149619252_10153066985824253:Finally opened in Rialto, CA 4-5 days ago went on the 3rd day opening and ran out of food!!!! Had to wait 2 hrs and only had chicken and less food but paid full price!!! Was not happy.
124149619252_130916887010628:Wow, I guess it could be anything from a farm, I'm gonna come as dirt, ya know like on theswiffer commercial. I just hope my date doesn't mind being manure!;-)
124149619252_10151089035244253:My least favorite was "St. Cloud" Minnesota as the time I went in after a long drive one day, these 2 girls were screaming racial remarks, as well as arguing about "how she said she couldn't use her phone to text her man"... Where as my favorite would be Elk River Minnesota, but :) take what you get... Every Franchise has their goods, and their pathetically unpoor service bads because someone doesn't do their job there.
124149619252_167132760066216:Im allergic to haikus like achoo.....so chipotle says no burrito for you....lmao oh well chipotle is still yummy in my tummy
124149619252_10153246130479253:Nice! now they have a reason to mark up their prices. I won't feel as bad pain for $10 burrito knowing its GMO free I guess
124149619252_10152250518069253:you guys suck and jack in the box gives away free tacos all the time...so that would count as free lunch...get with customer satisfaction. Come up with something equally as nice to stop the burn of the "so called hoax" because you were trending from that. Just saying.
124149619252_10150163730979253:Our daughter LOVED to be swaddled tight, and we used to call her our burrito baby.  Love this pic!  :)
124149619252_205082546217004:Notice that the study is "perceived healthful image."  That is not based on any food science at all.  They have bright colored pictures of veggies on the wall, so it looks good.  Also, and this bugs me to no end, Chris Gonzales....  you mean 'LOSE' not 'LOOSE.'
124149619252_10152407734029253:I vote a Mexican American author for a limited edition 32 ounce cup! This would be an awesome awareness campaign to highlight the outstanding literary contributions of Mexican Americans.
124149619252_10153543212484253:Need more food next year, we didn't get any :( Plus the stupid weather kept Walk the Moon from performing...
124149619252_10152250518069253:They never give anything away . Even the ships are $2 . That's why I changed to Moe's . Free chips and salsa and $2 off next order with every reciept if you do an online survey and loyalty program
124149619252_10152990683604253:Chipotle should start making chimichurri sauce, that stuff is delicious and would go great with steak burritos!
124149619252_454413931302356:When are you dunder head no nothings going to wake up and realize that the homo movement isn't about gay marriage or seeking equality, it's about advancing a homo agenda that will affect young children. If you don't believe this just Google NAMBLA, North American Man Boy Love Association.
124149619252_10152429436247741:My sister gets mad at me all the time because I say chi-pole-tay   But whatevs. Just gimme some tacos.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Norman Delatorre read the comments. .. looks like we weren't the only ones that left sofrita less ????
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thanks for taking a stand against GMO ingredients.  You are at the forefront of a shift that has to happen!
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito, white rice, half scoop black bean, half scoop pinto, chicken and steak double, a little bit of hot, sour cream, cheese and mix it up before you wrap it please...
124149619252_10150602702709253:Michael, we were forgiving with one syllable here and there. The haiku form and intent were there, and that was up to the judges. - Joe
124149619252_10151486609219253:i wich i have one of those:( i miss so much my chipotle...i dream with it...america is so far from Portugal...why not open here a chipotle? i can work there:D pleeeeease!!!
124149619252_10152603746354253:So excited and thankful for Chipolte for being the FIRST to lead the way in healthy and safe fast food.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Fajita Burrito bowl, no rice, easy pinto, barbacoa, extra, extra pico, cheese, lettuce, and corn, ooh just writing out out makes me hungry!!!
124149619252_10153022292109253:Missing Chipotle...need desperately in Ely, MN.  Tourist town, small college, big money in the summer lots of money here year round.  We support only two fast food restaurants currently: Subway & DQ.  No Mexican food in town at all.  Chipotle would rule!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Please Open a few Chipotle fast foods here in Puerto Rico, We want real food, We only have trash food like Mc donalds...
124149619252_10152949800154253:I was gonna take you here Cynthia I mean the first day of the year only comes once a year, thought a wonderful Chipotle burrito would be a great way to start a great year. But just another disappointment, they're closed.
124149619252_10153693560944253:Ever since you guys reopened on Washington. Your steaks are cooked well or burnt , not medium or medium rare any more, and it taste horrible
124149619252_10151086390274253:It was so sad knowing she and her partner will never compete together again. They were an awesome team and fun to watch!
124149619252_213264065363407:http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/files/2011/05/greater_food_culture.jpg here is a link that works, if it won't load for you
124149619252_10153236016399253:People who need prepared foods are not lazy and indolent-they are retirees who have chronic med.conditions  that afflict the aging body limiting mobility- before the onset of'the elderly,frail  period' in one's lifespan-it happens to everybody...
124149619252_10152250518069253:Well this should be considered false advertising social website or not we should all get a free burrito until March 20th let's be honest it will bring customers and also it will turn them away so you weigh the options Chipotle you weigh the options all I know is business
124149619252_10152004082504253:"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"  This is the full translation. source: www.loremipsum.net/
124149619252_117996238325437:better hope none of the ten winners have food allergies or they will get sick or worse. Chipotle does not adhere to their own, advertised, food allergy procedures. Will NEVER, EVER, visit them again.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Good luck a lot if locations ran out in Southern California, at least around me, at 4 o'clock. What really pisses me off is I waited in line that was out the door twice to be told when I got to the front that they ran out of sofritas. This is a national promotion and you run out by 4 o'clock and don't advise your customers of it. I wasted my time money gas and a shitload of promotion on social media for this. As someone who doesn't eat any animal products I went from being happy to very pissed off.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Yay!! Setting and example for other restaurants and taking a stand against GMOs. Thank you Chipotle! Much love! ??
124149619252_10153246130479253:Kewl! Perhaps now we can get the Chipotle at 3170 S Wadsworth Blvd, Lakewood, Colorado to stop putting other stuff in the food like hair or ladybugs? Or how about fresh chips instead of stale day old chips from the night before? Or how about not serving mushy salsa from the day before?  ;)
124149619252_10151024826814253:I have a suggestion. How about making a salsa and guacamole without onion? I can't ready onion anymore. I love the food and use to go there pretty often but can't anymore :) HELP!
124149619252_10151687038594253:Sign up early for two bonus hints! https://chipotle.promo.eprize.com/20th/?referrer=72054.YOUP6MEUPLG7C7UE
124149619252_100780796665922:As Chipotle lovers that travel the country eating Chipotle in as many different cities as we can (and a husband eating Chipotle weekly for 5 yrs) we were disappointed to find Center City Philly did not have a Chipotle when we arrived so we too decided to give in and go to Qdoba. 2 of the 5 of us felt ill b4 we even finished the .5 mile walk home. Luckily within weeks a Chipotle was completed. A half block down from Qdoba so we have returned to our weekly trips to Chipotle even walking in the snow to get our weekly fix. We march right passed the front of Qdoba & into our Chipotle that is just finishing our meal we have ordered on the iPad app & sit down and enjoy our meal! Thank you Chipotle for a quality product and a new location so we could add state #4 to our list of Chipotle visits :)
124149619252_10153009001449253:Jackie Christine Babiee u just get your tofu stuff and then give me the receipt and I will free chipotle. Lol
124149619252_10153736393409253:Good thing you focused on ridding those burritos of harmless GMOs instead of deadly E. coli.  Good work.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Good thing I went on your wall to check, cause guess what I was going to pick up for lunch ...not just me but our office today. Still going to have Chipotle just not one free lunch.
124149619252_134085872963:OMG. What an insult to Chipolte. Yeah, okay, so he won 5K. That's great. The video and song still sucked. Guess says a lot about the judges. Someone said it right earlier. Rap is NOT music. It's gibberish. WTH???

124149619252_10151024826814253:Joe you are only feeding into my chipotle carving.... I always get a bowl w/ chicken, brown rice, fajita, sour cream, corn and mild salsa  cheese, and lettuce. Sometimes, I can't resist and get a guacamole and chips.
124149619252_10151089035244253:My favorite is the 161 location in Columbus, Ohio. I do have to mention though that the Grove City location deserves an award for most improved. I did not like going there for a while and a friend wanted to stop so I put my opinion aside and we stopped. Much better - the staff is more friendly and the food is great. So a big hand to the manager for turning it around.I would actually drive an extra 10 miles to avoid going to that location. But now I am happy to say I have been back to the location a few times since.  ;-)
124149619252_10152406485254253:Opening a new store in my town.. Won't be going there. I rather not be a convenient target for a criminal.
124149619252_10152406485254253:Next, we'll find out that Cliven Bundy sells his cattle to Chipotle and the circle of bed-wetting panic will be complete.
124149619252_10151486609219253:Bowl: brown rice, black beans, fajita veggies, cilantro, hot salsa, lettuce and chicken :) I eat at Chipotle almost everyday.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Thank ya kindly Dria  chipotle could literally say "try our new gym sock burrito" and I'd be down for it.
124149619252_10150942028479253:The green one is underrated. I get it w Barbacoa, sour cream, veggies, cheese, guacamole in a hard shell taco. Chipotle <3
124149619252_10152571682409253:One needs to come to the Poughkeepsie area in upstate NY there is one in Middletown it's to far to travel to the only time I can get some is if I go to The City.
124149619252_10152250518069253:People complaining how they will never eat Chipotle again because Chipotle won't honor the hoax?  Fine.  That just means a shorter line at Chipotle for me!
124149619252_10152949800154253:Thank Goodness that you are closed. I would have spent my money elsewhere anyway. You cop haters don't deserve my money. "Hands Up, Don't Chipotle!"
124149619252_10153150981964253:I don't care how wrapped the thing is. It falls apart I still eat it off the floor like an animal. Easy on crack, guys.
124149619252_279121798773401:lol, I hear ya. i have to drive downtown or to stringtown to get my fix. don't care for the one on georgesville much.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggies bowl with rice, all the salsas, sour cream lettuce and guac with chips to scoop and lots of lemon :)
124149619252_10153246130479253:80% of scientists say GMOS are fine. I agree with them. Please don't become a fad place where you give into every public trend.
124149619252_10153232136249253:I admire the fact that Chipotle has high standards in regards to farm animals. I was so happy to see that you brought the carnitas back, since it's all my son eats there, but very disappointed in the new recipe as  it is very spicy and now he won't eat it. Please bring the original recipe back!!!
124149619252_10153020304519253:A couple of suggestions: Lower the price on your chips and more people will buy them. Secondly, raspberry flavored tea, next to the sweet and unsweet teas.
124149619252_10151086390274253:They didn't ruin the surprise - if u ready the caption it said Much luck....  The pic was put up before the match!!!!   
124149619252_10150987384894253:I woulda won if u would build one in my city(ocala,fl) instead you keep putting multiple locations in Orlando Tampa daytona and gainesville,I live within 100 miles of 20 of your restaraunts yet I have to drive 60 miles to the nearest one
124149619252_100780796665922:bummer...you are right...I had forgotten about that.  (BTW, I can't remember the two fellas that started it, either! - maybe because they are forgettable;-)
124149619252_10150719072154253:That's awesome for employees who want to celebrate Easter!!  I'll miss you, but I'll see you next Sunday... or maybe I'll eat there on Monday instead!!  ;)

124149619252_10153405438314253:Essay on a toothbrush on bag interesting. Prompted give and take about a Jules Verne favorite in CT yesterday.
124149619252_10153736393409253:Stay Prayed Up!! This could be an attack on our desire to eat less processed foods. This somehow reminds me of a documentary that I watched about a cult/ranch in Oregon who decided to use germ warfare to get one of their leaders elected. Just before the city's election, several of the cult/ranch members would go to the most popular town restaurant and spread contagious, life threatening germs, not into the food but in the air, on the door knobs, at the tables on the salt and pepper shakers to get the townspeople sick so that they would be too ill to go out and vote and their leader, who received majority vote, of course would win and so it was. The bacteria was not present in the food. It was all around the restaurant. I forgot the name of the ranch but it was in Oregon around the 80's or 90's.
124149619252_10150298717314253:Ah, reading these comments remind me why I love living in Southern California. I have a two minute drive to my nearest Chipotle (finding a parking spot can take an hour there though....LOL) and a 10 minute drive to the next nearest one. 
124149619252_156053474470:That is the best idea... EVAR!!! Please start your California campaign in San Jose at you First Street and Old Bayshore location. =)
124149619252_10151520750889253:Why do you apologize?!?  Grow a pair!!!!  Just let people know you're closed.  Come on Steve, stop being such a wimp!!!!!!
124149619252_10153624802079253:We're talking about the tacos, right? Because I've got a few friends who would be mighty upset if I were to start eating them... Lol...
124149619252_10151024826814253:double wrap, steak, brown rice, lettuce, tomato, sour cream, salsa. with that side of chips and salsa <3
124149619252_10152262999499253:Even though Wisconsin's closer, I think I'd rather go to Jersey until Minnesota finally gets this option. There's more for me to do in Jersey, anyway.
124149619252_10152927494854253:Disappointed!  @ the Buckeye Arizona location and 10 minutes to wait for chicken to be ready and the chefs empty bins are piling up, never seen it like this before, so I'm waiting let's see if they really care to serve me or not.
124149619252_10153872104594253:Send me my true loyalty rewards card Chipotle. I eat the Chipotle chicken burrito bowl every other day.
124149619252_10150182464364253:mmm...I had a Chiptole burrito yesterday with everything on it. It was over 1500 calories....i was happy.
124149619252_10151282414614253:The brand new Chipotle Mexican Grill on Old Dominion Drive in McLean, VA rocks! Thank you for opening up there. Please recognize John one of your team members there. He's very polite and works hard. Big fan of Chipotle.  Will be eating there a couple times a week since it's near my office
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito:chicken, black beans or pinto beans, brown rice, corn and cheese. chiplote has meals at the brink of perfection and taste.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Guacamole is $ 1.60 extra. Is that ok? For the love of god yes! Stop asking me, I practically live here!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak or chicken bowl. Extra white rice, no beans, mild, sour cream, cheese and a lil bit of lettuce. Chips and guacamole on the side.
124149619252_10153246130479253:YAY! :)  ...Now if only you can make all of the food ORGANIC too, that would be awesome and it would show that you really do care about your customers! :D
124149619252_10151817856739253:Hey Geoffrey, that's a heck of a cool story and request, and we wish we could help out with that one. The unfortunate part is that we don't ship our food like that, as we'd be afraid of making people sick. But we do appreciate your son's love for our food and our restaurants, and we hope we can see him when he gets back. In the meantime, we do very much appreciate his and his battalion's service in the line of duty for our country. We hope he and all of his fellow Marines get home safe too, when all is said and done. - Joe
124149619252_10153118469724253:And I've eaten chipotle wayyy too many times and the meats are never spicy!!! So this is a First .... Lol
124149619252_10153246130479253:Terrible decision to bow down to fear mongers who consistently show that they don't know what they're talking about, if they aren't outright lying to begin with...
124149619252_520689341285681:Thank you, thank you, thank you...for us and for the animals! Hopefully this example will lead a revolutionary dietand options change in restaurants! Best of luck with everything!   :)
124149619252_10153246130479253:Chipotle I am thrilled for the non-GMO, however my understanding is you have converted to using Rice Bran Oil.  I have Celiacs and am highly allergic to many other grains with the exception of white rice.  Many people with Celiac's have sensitivities to most grains (gluten free or not). Sad to find out I will no longer be able to eat at your establishment... do you think you will have some "grain free" options down the road?
124149619252_193042867405266:Chipotle is one of the things I miss the most from living in the US.  We need some here in Canada... Edmonton, AB to be exact! :)
124149619252_10152632602189253:with the riding a giant Chipotle burrito, I have two photos of that myself. one from this year. https://www.facebook.com/thesteelshark/photos/a.509170629211021.1073741963.201869679941119/509173582544059
124149619252_157777224183:PLENTY of green companies right here in your home state of Colorado that could of helped with solar panels!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:i like tofu, just not this.. spices taste gross.. weird consistency..  reminds me of spicy lentils.. i think if you gave it out in small sample cups to taste instead of having to put it on something and end up not liking it, you won't have to throw out a perfectly good burrito, bowl or taco..

124149619252_10153152979994253:Not much of an option @ the Salem, OR location. Less than 10 parking spaces and supposed to be for compact cars only!
124149619252_10152786808474253:Barbacoa bowl with a ton of sour cream and cheese, honey chipotle vinaigrette and chips to dip in it's deliciousness... Mmmmm
124149619252_10153262094399253:Wen I workd at chipotle I was in charge of making this every morning. Uuugh. But I love guacamole. So I would hook it uppp!!! Lol ?
124149619252_180887498696:I saw it in theatres. It was amazing and I recommended it everyone. I have alll the trailers on my links in facebook. Thank you Chipotle!
124149619252_10153022292109253:What "number" was the store on Arapahoe Road and I-25 (the old location).  Seems like you were in the neighborhood for a long time.
124149619252_10152453918534253:I think teachers should get a "free burrito for a year" card. I live off of your delicious cuisine! Gets me through the tough days! Love Chipotle! Keep up the great work, and open more grills!
124149619252_10152338457929253:Just came back from there! The employees are probably sick of seeing me lol. They're so nice though. :) they work really hard.
124149619252_520689341285681:BRING them to the east bay !! I have called the Walnut Creek, Pleasant Hill, Concord, Pinole and Layafette CA locations and they don't even know about it.. I want 5 now
124149619252_182076481805338:I heard a rumor there's one coming to Flagstaff, I hope it's true! As for AZ allowing firing for no reason, not true, I successfully won an unlawful termination complaint against a company there.
124149619252_10152054390879253:thanks for responding to Foodbabe.com's request for a list of ingredients and for taking action to get rid of GMO food!  I love your food and applaud your actions to offer  "sincerely" healthy food!
124149619252_10150262089049253:I fyou need oregano for your suburban chicago stores call me...oregano has taken over my front garden

124149619252_10151024826814253:I rock a primal diet, so i get: No rice or beans, fajitas, double meat: chicken and barbacoa, tomato, corn, green salsa, sour cream, cheese, guac, and lettuce. In a bowl of course. :)
124149619252_10152261058584253:So that is total BS.  I've been the reigning foursquare mayor of my local store for over a year and I get nothing.
124149619252_322643590240:question.   when will the burrito delivery move to california! cuz me and my friends REALLY want to know.
124149619252_10152883478794253:Nick Shafer Marc Miller Jordan Dockter Matt Wagner Steve Adam Alex Cizek Andy Isenberg Cody Drysdale Travis Parks Rey Kiengsavath Trav Rotegard

124149619252_185864848093833:Why are people so rude all the time with their posts on Chipotle's Facebook page? There is no need for it.  What is wrong with everytong lately?
124149619252_10152004082504253:Dave Leopardi, even though Ricky did totally fail, Spanish is NOT the #1 spoken language in the USA. English speakers (80%) far outnumber Spanish speakers (12%).
124149619252_10153693560944253:Until someone shows really proof that Chipotle Mexican Grill really was the cause I'm still a fan. I like the people that work at the Bridgewater Falls Lifestyle Shopping Center Chipotle Mexican Grill.
124149619252_156053474470:UGH I just moved away from Columbus a few weeks ago!!!! I live in Vegas now, so bring delivery here please thanks!
124149619252_10153071221514253:I'll do what I did to Taco Bell when they pissed me off. Steve Pro - I walked into their establishment and dropped my drawers and dropped a duece right in the dining area. I smiled during this and as I was walking out.
124149619252_10153001213604253:Chipotle is now my go to place for Mexican food. The Vegan option is also looking very good. A huge Thank You to the CEO for this decision.
124149619252_10153656854824253:Not once did we cut the avacados like this when i worked there. We just pushed the knife through the pit.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie fajita burrito. Pintos (yum bacon) and black beans. Fajita veggies. Pico and Corn. Sour cream, cheese, guac, lettuce. Open it up, eat the guts with a fork. Fold up the tortilla and eat it like a delicious, guac covered pastry.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl: white rice, chicken, pinto beans, hot salsa, mild salsa, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and guacamole...
124149619252_164816057005566:I ate the tofu in sf and I LOVE it!!! It is spicy and delicious! And I'm not a tofu lover but this is good! Please send it everywhere! : ) 
124149619252_228034027252006:this is some bull crap.  i got (at least one) free burrito on halloween every year since 2003!!   u guys need to quit selling out.  also, starting this at 6pm is a dumb new(ish) rule too.  i am an avid chipotle fan but what gives ?!?
124149619252_10151906029579253:Last year it was $2 the year before $1 and before that free. I appreciate proceeds are going to a good cause but if keep raising we'll be paying full price before we know it. All this aside I'm super pumped!
124149619252_130916887010628:Have you people seen the price of antibiotic free meats these days?  Businesses are going under right and left.  They are doing you a favor with $2 burritos.  Stop whining that's it's not free.  If you don't want to dress up for a discount burrito, don't go.
124149619252_10152250518069253:For all the people complaining that this is "not fair" and is "false advertising" shouldn't be blaming Chipotle for not accepting it and need to think about morality. Chipotle is an amazing company and it really isn't "fair" that they should lose millions in profit across their 1500+ locations because someone with access to Google Images decided they wanted to scam free food with making their own coupon. And to all the people who know it is a lie and still want to benefit for your selfish desires- shame on you. For all the other people who decided not to try Chipotle because it will not be free- you are missing out! It will be the best spent ~$7
124149619252_156053474470:You Better do this in  AUSTIN TEXAS AUSTIN TEXAS AUSTIN TEXAS AUSTIN TEXAS     AUSTIN TEXAS. Were such a college town it would be insane not to

124149619252_10153246130479253:People are so dumb it physically hurts Thank you Chipotle for making a change and hopefully some will follow in your footsteps.
124149619252_10150260445594253:I love farms, I love Chipotle. Steve Ells you stay true to your vision and never stray from that path!
124149619252_10152307671269253:Thank you Chipotle (Huntington, WV Marshall University 5th ave location). The fundraiser was a success and with you help Get Your Wig On (www.getyourwigon.com) can help give the gift of hair to those women affected by cancer and chemotherapy treatments during the Fighting Cancer One Wig At A Time event!  The staff was wonderful and I loved the wigs worn by the staff during the fundraiser!  Adam the manager is an asset to our community and your company!  Thanks again!!!!
124149619252_10153542268884253:University of Denver wins because the original is 5 minutes walking distance. Granted we don't have football...but we have the original. And that's enough.
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito bowl with rice, 1/2 carnitas and 1/2 chicken, salsa and cheese and sour cream : ) I love the rice honestly could even do the rice salsa, sour cream and cheese too
124149619252_10151611917404253:It's amusing to read how bad people want to eat at a Chipotle and how it's on their bucket list... I frequent Chipotle about 2-3 times a week and have 6 locations within a 5 mile radius of my home. I guess we are spoiled here in Ohio :)
124149619252_100720426611000:no way nathan! I always get more yummyness with a bowl and then when u get chips it just makes for an amazing combo! just had some yesterday after church, and it was very goooood!
124149619252_199537401806:Great feedback! But as a blanket response, some of you are asking about places where we already have Chipotles, like Colorado where we were started. Go to www.chipotle.com/locations and do a search near you. Chances are we're down the block. Hope that helps! - Colin
124149619252_10152407734029253:Chipotle is amazing!  Love how there's no GMO! I'll pay higher prices for your food to keep it all organic. I had a burrito bowl for the first time today in a while and it was heaven!
124149619252_10152250518069253:It wouldn't have been "free" anyway... People would have had to spend time liking and sharing that. Time is money, Joe!
124149619252_10152632602189253:Mistie  it's too late for me to do the anniversary pictures but you have to try. Sabrina  I'm leaving it up to you to get my baby that onsie whenever we have one. :) oh! We need to get the puppies dog tags in the shape of burritos!! Hahaa

124149619252_10150959152619253:NOT IN GREENVILLE, NC WHICH DESPERATELY NEEDS A CHIPOTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (big college town by the way, i have many friends that drive and hour to Raleigh just to get Chipotle)
124149619252_10151058843154253:I'm guessing as well that it's platinum certified because it is wind powered from the windmill on top 
124149619252_212886842115332:Our first Chipotle experience was in Gainesville, FL- I can't tell you how thrilled we are that you have a restaurant here in Greenville!! Thank you!
124149619252_10153589344059253:Chipotle Mexican Grill Chipotle Mexican Grill when is the next time you guys are doing a career day unfortunately I wasn't hired on the recent one but I'm persistent and will like to participate and try again
124149619252_10153351140389253:I love your food and it's great that your food is now GMO free. However, you still serve sodas that have GMO. Are you planning on dumping the GMOs all together and replacing your Coke products with a NON GMO soda on the fountain?
124149619252_10153903490999253:Love your food!  The store at 3822 E Broad St, Whitehall, OH...  ALWAYS great customer service and clean.
124149619252_147322035888:Great.  Now I have to drive 30 mins to the nearest location cuz I'm jonesin for a chicken fajita burrito.  Like I have nothing else to do with my life.  Leaving now
124149619252_10151089035244253:My favorite is the one in Boulder Colorado because that's where I'm from!  A close second is the one in Kingstowne VA next to John Reed Shope who I am a huge fan of!!!!
124149619252_10152250518069253:To the people saying that Chipotle sucks for not honoring it: who sucks here?  Them for not honoring it or you for believing it and getting all worked up?  Hint: it isn't them.  Hell, I say that they charge the people who believed it double.
124149619252_10151089035244253:North Olmsted, Ohio. They have the BEST staff and the manager is awesome! The food is always amazing and the place is so clean.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I love sofritas. Being raised a vegetarian, I know have more than just one option at Chipotle. And it's delicious, too.
124149619252_212886842115332:Seriously? You're boycotting spending a couple bucks which goes to aid family farmers? I hope you gave yourself a pat on the back you douchebags. I for one am grateful for the discounted price and am proud to support family farming in America. Thanks Chipotle.

124149619252_10152949800154253:"We are not at liberty to say" with regards to the actions you took regarding the worker in question?  Read as:  we didn't do anything substantial, but are making it seem like we did.
124149619252_10152406485254253:I will not patronize the restaurants from this day forward. Go ahead, be part of the PCP and watch your revenues fall.
124149619252_10151089035244253:The new location in Davie, FL! I haven't been there yet but it is a the difference between a 20 mile trip to a 8 mile trip!
124149619252_10151024826814253:steak burrito, black beans, white rice, easy hot salsa, corn salsa, extra sour cram and extra cheese, chips and guac on the side
124149619252_10152382144342741:Ya Pamela, I agree with the line, but I think they want to keep it unique this way, may I suggest a good change.  Have people fill out a card checking off what they want, then at the bottom give your order a catchy name and when it ready, they call out your order..it would be fun to see what people name their orders.
124149619252_10153296787694253:I just found out that a newly open Chipotle Mexican Grill is with in range of my power wheel chair. This makes me so happy. I can now enjoy your GMO Free menu! And also eat healthy. Keep up the great work Chipotle!!!
124149619252_182076481805338:Not trying to be gay or anything. But what happened with this cat story? I haven't heard anything about it
124149619252_10153262094399253:I worked at Chipotle and yes that really is the actual recipe...scaled down of course. That's why I love that place...simple fresh ingredients and recipes made fresh every single day. Best guacamole ever and it's so easy to make
124149619252_163075200578:I would like this post if A. there was actually a Chipotle in Boise, Idaho and/or I was in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas. B. If I actually had a child to take and C. Now I want Chipotle (thank you Very Much!!)
124149619252_10151089035244253:Any location, I have to travel more than an hour to get to one. When will Chipotle open in Scranton, PA?
124149619252_10151086390274253:Thank you Chipotle for a restaurant in London!  That's one more place that I know I can go without fear of starvation!!  I go to my four Chipotles often enough that one of your employees actually cleaned my regular table for me as I was getting my ice tea.  Another employee at another location knows that I get white rice, and black beans in a bowl.  Your people are the greatest!!!
124149619252_156053474470:It's finally good that I live in Columbus! Yay! Keep doin what you do chipotle! (except charging for guacamole!)
124149619252_10152250518069253:I remember the ol'days when if you went to Chipotle on Halloween dressed as a burrito you got free food...... What happened to that!
124149619252_10153872104594253:Interesting that I did not once read about a organic non gmo eater getting sick.  Gee, what would be different about our guts compared to the ones that got sick.

124149619252_10153389325099253:In the bathroom because I don't get a long enough break to eat lunch! Nor do I make enough to buy a burrito that's worth an hour of labor before taxes are taken out.
124149619252_10151307314369253:I love you chipotle. ive spent probably thousands on burritos. The bestttttt fix!! Merry chrismas guys!

124149619252_109031815838831:Wow Amber, everybody here being positive, and you have to find something negative jump on the negativity train?  Maybe if you got a free burrito, you'd find something to smile about...

124149619252_10152018242589253:This is near Denver University Campus. It had been a Dolly Madison Ice Cream store. They were small stores that sold great ice cream, had a soda fountain with stools. Usually staffed by one person, mostly older ladies. I used to order a 5 gallon drum of Spumoni around this time of year, it was a seasonal thing. Truly loved it but also became smitten with Chipotle Mexican Grill and was SO HAPPY when they came to Richmond, Va.
124149619252_10153270305244253:I'll probably get a salad next time I go to Chipotle. But, this time I'll probably order it without sour cream.
124149619252_10151687038594253:It puts me in an endless loop.  Every time I put in an answer, it sends me back to the log-in screen.  Very frustrating.

124149619252_10153009001449253:Giving up meat has been one of my greatest dietary challenges of my life. I have made good progress but still eat the delicious meat regularly. Less red meat, more fish and chicken.
124149619252_10150959152619253:would love to know why there isn't a Chipotle at DIA... Minus the chophouse its an awful airport to eat in!
124149619252_10152949800154253:Most people who say I'm never eating at Chipotle again WILL eat there again. Its all just temporary venting which is very therapeutic. And for the very few who will truly not eat there again you will NOT be missed and you will NOT affect their market share because as your leaving many others are coming. Point being, your not as important as you think you are :-)
124149619252_10152632602189253:I bet they would change their mind if they ate at our Chipotle in Zanesville!!  Burnt dry chicken every time.  No flavor in steak or rice!  I drive out of town for good chipotle! And over 13.00 for my bowl and drink!  I can go to the buffet for that.      But I do love a "good chipotle"!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Aw man I'm craving chipotle!! A lot of yumminess in a bowl or burrito is how I like it and chipotle does it how I like it :)
124149619252_10151906029579253:It's not free anymore because the proceeds from this are going to charity. boorito.com explains the three major issues it is supporting. I will gladly pay 3 bucks for an amazing meal, and to help a good cause.
124149619252_10151024826814253:LUV this place the only place I could find when I had to stay on a strict diet. SO healthy, I'm so glad someone had a great idea and made it healthy.

124149619252_140229971715:why do you keep sending me Arizona Info?  I live in Colorado.  I would love to go to Arizona, but I really enjoy my Colorado Chipolte!
124149619252_10152560126959253:But I always order salad, I *do* exist! And it's meatless to boot. "Veggie salad, light pintos, corn, tomatoes, light sour cream and cheese, plenty of guac, dressing, chips, iced tea" doused generously with smoky chipotle Tabasco sauce.
124149619252_10153246130479253:GMOs aren't bad though.  I've looked for around and found no evidence to prove otherwise. All that's gonna happen is Chipotle will get more expensive.
124149619252_10153563062919253:I love when everyone takes the opportunity on this post to complain about bad meals recently at chipotle.... Instead of being smart and mentioning it to a manager while actually at the store.
124149619252_10151089035244253:I can say one locale to avoid: West 42nd St by Bryant Park in NYC. Place was a sloppy mess and the Men's Restroom was locked. I emailed Chipotle Management and they know about my complaint.
124149619252_10152406485254253:To say I'm angry with your hipster anti CC opinion is an understatement..... Sad, I enjoyed eating here too
124149619252_10151892810414253:Congrats to the winners.  I think it was a great promotion and Chipotle gave away a lot of free food!  Well done Chipotle.  By the way, I joined the farm team and opted for the t-shirt.  Love it!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Burrito, black beans white rice, medium salsa, cheese, sour cream. Sometimes the hot salsa just to keep me from inhaling it too quickly!
124149619252_10152250518069253:HOW DARE YOU GUYS NOT GIVE ME A FREE BURRITO. I DID NOTHING TO EARN IT BUT YOU OWE IT TO ME BECAUSE SOME KNUCKLEHEAD TOTALLY UNAFFILIATED WITH YOU GUYS SAID YOU WOULD GIVE IT TO ME. Chipotle uses higher quality ingredients than any other mexican chain. They have high food costs, and they pay for labor so that there are people to make the burrito for you. They're a business, not a charity. Get over it.
124149619252_10151961054499253:Thanks for the BOOrito event.  We had a great time and your staff was prepared, they looked good and they served a LOT of people swiftly and accurately!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Javier Casas Ivan Lozano Ptr Gus Y Areli Mendez... what about this one for Monday?  I mean... we can get a free one for later... just an idea.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Three soft flour chicken tacos with corn and cheese inside, accompanied by sides of mild and guac. Put those bad babies on the tort press and you have the most delicious mini quesadillas of all time.
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken burrito with black beans, corn, lettuce, sour cream, and double rice and cheese. with chips and medium salsa.
124149619252_122372141178171:I like Chipotle a lot but their food has more sodium than I think would be considered healthy. Even my kids comment on how salty the food is!
124149619252_10153200118729253:Hey has anyone cared that Chipotle said they would go NON GMO and more organic but NEVER did. Even tho when that was said, their sells went up but like 30%. This was over 2 years ago...im I the only one who remember this lie?
124149619252_10152949800154253:The hate in here is so misguided and unnecessary; direct your hatred towards the ignorant, uneducated pigs who have abused their power. What that employee did was brave and bold, whether or not it had anything to do the company. Let those murderous pigs feast on the ashes on the innocents they have slain.
124149619252_10153438315219253:Happy Birthday, Chipotle!  You're a Cancer?! Me too! Moon babies rock! I will celebrate my bday with a Chipotle feast!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl, no meat, both kinds of beans, lettuce, cheese, corn salsa, tomato salsa, sour cream, and guac.
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito, lots of rice, extra cilantro, steak & chicken (extra not half & half), corn & TONS of cheese!!!
124149619252_10152262999499253:I tried this last week and thought it was good. I would order it again. Thanks Chipotle Mexican Grill
124149619252_213264065363407:LOVED Chipotle until I got a bad case of FOOD POISONING last week from your Denton, TX location. I was sick for 3 days straight and couldn't eat anything solid for 5 days.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Let's open Chipotle n the Conyers, Covington, Decatur, Lithonia, Stone Mountain area. That's  Georgia baby.
124149619252_10151089035244253:Rancho the people that work at the one in rancho ca. Are the best they treat you like family the food is always so fresh
124149619252_492523374093310:Hello, my name is Charlene an I'm an addict...lol, NO but seriously I am so addicted to Chipotle I need CA, just like an alcoholic needs AA, as a matter of fact, I will be right back going to get a hit right...lmbo
124149619252_10151089035244253:Chipolte (puke)-Last 2x was terrible fatty chicken and the last time I will ever go had bad taste in my mouth for hours after...I been goin to Pita Pit instead=AWSOME! Goin now to remove Chipolte from my page now...
124149619252_10152262999499253:Thank you so much Chipotle!! This means a lot to vegans like me. You're the first fast food chain that cares about our existence!
124149619252_244699472217532:Chipotle is already filled with a bunch of religious diet keepers so fish would actually be a good idea
124149619252_10152250518069253:I was going to share that page a friend sent but first I wanted to see if it really was real. Tomorrow I'm taking my son, daughter and brother to Chipotle for my son's 23rd birthday. It would have been nice to get one free.
124149619252_10153319767964253:I have a solution for you, amazine!!!   You can accomplish all three by eating a modest bowl of TJ's Ultra Chocolate Ice Cream (which is also the same as Double Rainbow Ultra Chocolate Ice Cream....either one will do the job)  The best chocolate ice cream ever, containing a nugget of the meaning of life (you will have to keep looking for more nuggets of course.....), and the absolute opportunity to fall in love.  You're so welcome :)
124149619252_10152881168629253:Love chipotle..... they are beginning to get on my nerves though.....being chinsy on portions....they are slowly losing my business. ...
124149619252_10151024826814253:I usually get a burrito bowl, brown rice, fajitas, chicken, extra mild salsa, sour cream, corn, and cheese. My favorite order though is a burrito with brown rice, steak, fajitas, extra mild salsa, sour cream, corn, and cheese. Ive had chipotle every day for the past 3 days. Delectable.
124149619252_10153395310879253:Thanks for the support Chipotle. If only these haters would really stop eating your delicious food maybe the line wouldn't wrap around the inside of your store and often out the door. Your continued success is without doubt stamped in concrete. See you again soon.
124149619252_10152805746454253:I can't have a #boorito because I live in Bismarck, ND, and the closest Chipotle is 5 hours away. Please change that soon!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:I was so excited to do this, being vegetarian, but when I got to my Chipotle they told me they were CLOSED! What the hell? They've been advertising this day for months and I was really excited to get a tasty burrito because I love the sofritas, but I couldn't! Really disappointed.
124149619252_205455487672:you have no idea how excited I was when you guys opened one like 10 mins from my college! no one that I've talked to from my school knows what  chiptole is! they only know moe's and its deff not as good as chiptole!
124149619252_10150262089049253:Hey, to all you neighsayers about Chipotle using locally grown...Chef's Garden provides organic food supplies to many local restaurants. They are a wonderful addition to our community, and we appreciate them greatly. Don't like it? Too bad. WE DO!!
124149619252_10153246130479253:The biotech industry has spent $575 million lobbing, paying off, politicians so GMO's will not get labeled yet they are labeled in over 60 other countries.
124149619252_10152236327209253:i hate being a vegan in houston and with a chipotle right by where i live by this coul dbe wat ive been waiting for!!!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken burrito bowl, white rice, black beans, extra mild salsa, corn, cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and guacamole! :) delicioso
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito bowl, brown rice, carnitas, black beans, mild salsa just a little, just a little corn, cheese, guacamole(Yes I know it costs more) and sour cream to go.
124149619252_276686529106628:Great event, we'll try to make it! http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/182816/going-green-from-all-angles.html
124149619252_10153693560944253:I ate at one in central PA about 3 weeks ago. A week later I ended up in the ER with a HORRIBLE pain in my stomach (lower right side) It was the worse "stomach bug" I have ever had my entire life. Lasted 6 days!  I don't think they tested me for E Coli because I didn't have the other symptoms yet. My stomach still isn't 100 percent, you can still hear it rumbling/gargling and I still don't have an appetite.
124149619252_10152250518069253:I'm glad the employees in the stores are not this rude. I would never want this type of statement made by a service industry company that should appreciate all the money we spend on your products because I don't know anyone that can go just once.
124149619252_185864848093833:Gross. And unnecessary. I wonder though, how many pounds of antibiotics go into one pound of meat? I wish the article would have stated that.
124149619252_279121798773401:Chipotle is fantastic.  But for some reason the person in front of me in line always acts like they've never been there before.  Go to Taco Bell moron, you're holding me back from my football sized carne asada burrito!
124149619252_10151024826814253:I love to get a chicken salad bowl with no dressing. Cilantro rice, black beans and fajitas. I get two of the salsas, some cheese and a little of the sour cream and then head right over to the condiment section and grab a bottle of the Chipotle sauce and eat like a king!
124149619252_185864848093833:i love meat ....you tree huggers wont stop me ! go eat your tofu .....ive raised animals and have taken animal science classes there are guideline galore about what can be used and how long before slaughter they can be given ! some people believe anything on the internet ....
124149619252_10152250518069253:Natalie Haydon ya big let down for me too, but better to find out that look like a idiot at the checkout.  :)
124149619252_10152560126959253:My order: Quesatacos...Same concept as a Quesarrito, except with tacos. Chipotle, please serve these!
124149619252_10151058843154253:6kw wind turbine, rooftop rain water collection for watering plants, high efficiency appliances, outside lighting that produces less "spill" to minimize "light polution", lighter colored concrete to reduce heat around building, native plants more durable and needing less irrigation, reflective roof with better insulation, high efficiency HVAC, recycled building materials (used in construction and recycle from the building's construction), "green housekeeping" - less chemicals used to clean, water conserving bathroom fixtures, low odor building materials (VOC), and smart enegy management system.    (LEED stuff is very interesting to me.. so I had to look up what you did.   I know this is NOT cheap to build this type of building, but the return on environment and the long-term return on investment is great for the planet.. and your company!)
124149619252_10150719072154253:Regardless of what you're celebrating or not celebrating, hope your employees enjoy the day with friends and families.  Thanks for your amazing service and product over the years.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl with brown rice, pork or chicken, tomato salsa, corn salsa, sour cream, guacamole, cheese, and lettuce! Yum yum!
124149619252_10153009001449253:I'm in snowpocalypse territory and it started snowing much earlier than anticipated. I'm so disappointed!
124149619252_10151892810414253:still disappointed they accepted those wrong answers just to make the complainers happy.  :(  slap in the face to those of us that got them right instead of using the common answers.
124149619252_10151185000424253:well, if you had one closer to Huntington, WV than Freakin' Athens, OH, I would be able to do this....
124149619252_10152250518069253:Too bad. But not Chipotle's fault. Are we mad at every other restaurant who also isn't offering free food, but who didn't have the misfortune to be misrepresented?
124149619252_10152925087634253:I accidentally deleted my free sofritas text, anyway I can recover it or get another one?? Please help chipotle
124149619252_10150260445594253:I know times are tough,  but they have been skimping on the toppings. 1/2 a spoon of meat anymore when it used to be heaping full,  a small pinch of cheese (Skyline Chili gives you near half a pound on their plate...). I like the food but am tired of paying for mostly rice.
124149619252_100721346610908:Hey Kevin-is this really in Colorado Springs (Powers an Carefree?) I do believe it is!!! I live in Colorado Springs too and my Chipolte is over on the west side (GOTG and Centennial)-I just finished a Burrito! Yummies!
124149619252_142788962468209:Bob, if you did some homework, you'd know that houses in California are framed with Douglas Fir that is sustainably farmed in Oregon and Washington -- not with anything from the rainforests of Brazil.  And my wife, who survived Mt. Pinatubo, would be happy to tell you what happens to a concrete house in an earthquake.  We do not build from concrete here because the reinforcement to meet earthquake standards is cost-prohibitive.  Aside from that, manufacturing steel reinforcement for concrete houses has a much higher carbon footprint than timber farming.
124149619252_135973769252:Actually, there is a train that goes to the bronx-- it's called the Metro North and it stops on Fordham Road by the SEARS hahah.
124149619252_182078509223:@Cameron: You're an idiot. Phytoestrogen =/= estrogen.  @Chipotle: I agree that whole grain tortillas and brown rice would be EXCELLENT. Corn tortillas would be awesome too.  @All: Ever notice that the rabidly anti-vegan tend to be overweight? ;)
124149619252_10153246130479253:That's quite the feat!. Now if we can get America to stop like may of the rest of the world we wouldn't struggle so badly with obesity!
124149619252_10152406485254253:@Yesenia Unlike other groups, we're not going to yell and complain that all Chipotles be shut down because of their (poor) choice. Instead, we will take our business elsewhere.
124149619252_10153608850569253:Chipotle in Minnesota = please teach your employees at the coon Rapids location to properly put in ingredients.
124149619252_10153340431804253:#BGSU is at #39, when in reality the chipotle is directly across the street from campus, not .66 miles away. If you look on a map it's across the street from campus. BGSU should be #1.

124149619252_10152883478794253:How shameful Chipolte turned off the ability to comment on their page and spread their voice before they would just answer to the faults of their employees.
124149619252_10153734396969253:I love your company hope no one is trying to as sabotage your company you stood up for better food and nongmo don't give up
124149619252_115365598544868:I absolutely ADORE Chipotle!! Everytime someone wants to meet for lunch, I take them there. Even some of my co workers eat there now. I love the one near my job - the atmosphere is so alive and they're so very friendly! The only down side - delivery. On the other hand, I enjoy the walk :D 
124149619252_140229971715:5 free burrito vouchers when you put $100 on a meal deal card, enter promo code facebook and enter to win a free burrito party for you and 50 friends..CHIPOTLE ROCKS
124149619252_10151089035244253:The store on Louetta Rd and Hwy 249 in Houston is the best!  Sebastian and his crew are the nicest group!  I have one closer to me, but I still go there.
124149619252_10153656854824253:Pavlovian response...when she put the container of guac in the tray at the end, did anyone else think to themselves, "It's a dollar ninety-five extra, is that okay?" :)
124149619252_10151251776579253:i thought i just liked it then i thought abought it and then i liked it like like, then themore i like liked liked it just seeemed i couldn't not like like like like like it ...like ya know lolololololo
124149619252_10150256700954253:screw chipotle they jacked up their prices!!!is sad because that was one of the reasons i would go there 3 times a week and now thats all done i will never go to another chipotle again so i hope they are happy for losing many valued customers i think i head over to buffalo wild  wings and save some money!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Ok- I was on weight watchers and I ate this at least 2-3 times a week:  bowl with lettuce on the bottom, black beans, fajita veggies, tomato, medium and corn salsas, chicken, and more lettuce on the top!!!  Delish and lost weight by cutting out the rice and cheese!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl. extra white rice, light black beans, steak, mild salsa, extra sour cream, extra cheese!!!!!!!!!!
124149619252_100913656591677:holy crap....I just got home after a 16 hour work/school day and I could totally go for a big fat ass burrito!!!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:soft tacos, carnitas, white cilantro rice, corn salsa, cheese and sour cream. Side of chips with 2 tomato salsas. YUM!
124149619252_10152250518069253:This is soooo wrong!! Sometimes u gotta be at the right place at the right time!! Got my free lunch from tcf bank at chipotle for donating can goods!! ???? last week
124149619252_213189592025031:I'm not closed minded but have examined the evidence. Just because I see Earth Day for what it is does not mean that I don't take care of it.
124149619252_10153319767964253:Juniperus Californica your drawings could be on chipotle cups!! This looks like the one you just finished
124149619252_10152805746454253:After my husband orders his boorito it has to be double wrapped with 2 tortillas! They are huge! Me, I love my salad bowls! ????
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito or as a bowl: Brown rice. Half Barbacoa half carnitas. Veggies. Black beans. Sour cream. Pico and lettuce.  
124149619252_10153374411259253:It is delicious but sadly I'm done with Chipotle since I'm tired of picking out way too much meat that I pay for due to gristle making it inedible.
124149619252_185864848093833:Ugh people need to get educated before posting. Funny how people think Chipotle is healthy. How many calories are in a burrito? More than a big mack. I like chipotle because its good, not because its half organic, (half organic pretty much is not organic btw) and i hate their advertising and think people that believe it are nuts!
124149619252_10152786808474253:Steak crispy tacos with tomato salsa, cheese, and sour cream! Sometimes some guacamole...might have to try the carnitas and barbacoa ????
124149619252_215673425111837:Jose, there's two in south Carolina. And a third will be open next week. One in Columbia and one in Greenville!
124149619252_10151258924194253:THANK YOU! Although your Surprise, Az location is the best ever (I have been as far as NY) anyway, they deserve a day of thanks, family and rest. Happy Thanksgiving!!
124149619252_10153236016399253:"Indolent and lazy". Thanks, people like me who like Chipotle, but are still recovering from surgery and can't really go out like being called lazy.

124149619252_10150637170574253:When is TOFU chorizo coming to Winchester, VA? Also, the golden peppers probably add a bunch of flavor to the food, eh? ;-)
124149619252_156053474470:That would be cool. I also wish some locations had drive-thru windows. That would make picking up dinner even easier!
124149619252_10152104828699253:Brittany and Karina, did you know we have several locations in London, a location in Paris and one in Frankfurt? You can find them here: http://chip.tl/uVWK0X. -Myra
124149619252_520689341285681:don't knock it till you try it!  If Chipotle is creating it, it's got to be good!!  I hope it comes to MD!!
124149619252_10153200118729253:Joe - I would argue that Chipotle is the PERFECT place for a first date.  First, like "meeting for coffee" it's quick.  If the date isn't going well, it won't be dragged out across a three hour, several-course-meal.  However, unlike meeting at a coffee joint, Chipotle Mexican Grill has burritos.  Second, it's delicious.  Both parties will be in a great mood just eating a delicious burrito or bowl.  This will allow both parties to become better acquainted.  Third, the minimalist design of the place is just hip enough to show that you're a person who knows how to have a good time, while at the same time, a person who knows the value of a dollar.  :)
124149619252_185864848093833:why cant we just go to chipotle and eat the food because we like it? Most of us don't want to hear about how farm animals are raised or how much antibiotics they are given. Just let us enjoy your food with out all the bull...I love Chipotle, but if you are going to keep posting stuff about such things, you will start loosing customers. keep all the politics out of it!
124149619252_10153253574299253:Lawd help me. ????????  Chipotles tacos can be anyday! Why you sooooo good?! I need these now with a side of hot please Joe!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl~White rice, half beef/chicken, black beans, pico, lil med, lil hot, corn, lettuce and cheese. Sour cream and guacamole on the side.  Lol. Delicious, oh so fresh!
124149619252_182078509223:lets get some vegan chipotle options in Illinois, please! the chicagoland area! there's tons and tons of people who would LOVE that!
124149619252_178542422170361:had chipotle in South Portland lastnight  and going back again tonight! missed it soo much and happy they are crazy busy on their opening week, every soda in the fountain was sold out and they even ran out of forks!! on a sunday!! :)
124149619252_10152560126959253:Steak burrito double meat, rice black beans, hot salsa, light cheese, extra sour cream.  I guess I'm the burrito however you make it group. And yes, I answer surveys that way.  Nailed it.
124149619252_10151258924194253:I'm happy to see y'all giving your employees the day off.  I wish the big box retailers (and the customers who support it) would also join suit.  There are only two days like this a year.  I wouldn't want my family member not at Thanksgiving because they had to work.  Leave it to emergency personnel only.
124149619252_365284166822162:Elena - it's not the same thing. If you're allergic to wheat simply the contact of being in the burrito will make you sick.
124149619252_10152407734029253:wait, I thought this thread was about the cute writing on the cups. Silly barrel heads! I like this cultivating thought thing. Maybe because I prefer words to ammunition.
124149619252_10151279478234253:Chipotles has the right idea!  Organic free range meat ...in a fast food restaurant.  Almost too good to be true!
124149619252_10152250518069253:They already give buy one get one cards occasionally. Why does everyone think they are so entitled? You eat there a lot because you like it.
124149619252_10152250518069253:What is even sadder is that chipolte is letting people stand in long lines and wait to u get to pay and then tell u! U think they would post a sign on the door.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito Bol: no beans, extra rice, steak, mild salsa, hot salsa, corn salsa, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, NIRVANA
124149619252_10153246130479253:Romie Prasad pollo loco is the next chipotle.  Chipotle stock is too high priced. My high market cap is already in biotech (Biogen). Loco is new and has only one way to go...up.
124149619252_10153135670549253:I love Chipotle but carnitas is off the menu. That's the only burrito I want.  So I'm patiently waiting....
124149619252_208335555885615:So I just got a message from our fellow extra terrestrials and they're wondering when you guys can open up a store maybe on the Moon or Mars or something. They're thinking maybe they could teleport a store across the galaxy so they wouldn't have to scare the wits out of Earthlings everytime they come for a burrito.  Just a thought.
124149619252_10151053134024253:At a Chipotle restaurant's outdoor deck back in December 2010. My teeth were chattering as I was eating my burrito
124149619252_10153240834269253:Let's open Chipotle n the Conyers,  Covington, Decatur, Lithonia, Stone Mountain area. That's Georgia baby.
124149619252_10152262999499253:Mike Belden....def would rather have this over a fat fajita grill burrito.....Nelson can bench 150 too.....lulz
124149619252_10152560126959253:steak burrito with white rice & pinto beans, medium salsa, sour cream, cheese and tons of lettuce plus medium salsa and chips. i'm a girl who loves to eat and i enjoy my food! 
124149619252_10153150981964253:Please put one of ur AMAZING restaurants in my town, New Philadelphia,Oh. We'd all be truly grateful!!!
124149619252_10151258924194253:As a Kitchen Manager for Chipotle i can speak for my team is that we appriciate the day off to spend with our families.. Another reason why I love working for this company... I hope everyone has a wonderful Thanksgiving
124149619252_10153145422064253:I have no idea who these bands are,  but still sounds like fun plus they say it's a Free Event and I love Chipotle so we should check it out. . :) lol Tiara Leshai
124149619252_10153569576059253:Chipotle is almost to the caveman meal harvesting meat from animals that are not fed GMO feed is the last step. Keep trying you are almost there.
124149619252_205082546217004:I think Chipotle was the most realistic, the other results were people sleeping when taking those reviews????
124149619252_10152390794454253:Hey Joe..... Please please please bring your wonderful restaurant to Coeur d'Alene Idaho!!!!  We are in desperate need of such wholesome goodness!
124149619252_10153009001449253:when you say Organic do you really mean, That the Tofu is REALLY made with Organic Soy!???!  if so I might try it.  Soy in the USA is a Big GMO! so I'm a lil skeptical! B|
124149619252_10151961054499253:It's not responsible until the GMOs are gone. I know you're working on it, but I will not rest until you are the world's first GMO free fast food restaurant.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Kellogg's ceral is GMO free in Europe, the box reads: "Kellogg's in conscious of consumer preference and does not use GM maize or soy or their derivatives in our breakfast cereals.  But they still feed us the s***.
124149619252_10151719407409253:Yeah, the key is that there are two "when"s and two "they"s.  You have to use different ones for each puzzle (can't use the same "they" twice).  Pretty poor design :-/!
124149619252_10152406485254253:Thought i was going to give in and get chipotle but stuck to my decision to not. This lead me to try out mission burrito..............waaaaaaaaaay better . Thanks chipotle
124149619252_10152406485254253:I quite often frequented your San bernardino, redlands, and Ontario locations ..... no longer... won't get a dime from me....

124149619252_10152250518069253:Why do so many people think Chipotle is owned by McDonalds...? They were early investors but haven't been affiliated with Chipotle for years.
124149619252_10151961054499253:I love the chipotle food, arroz blanco con hierbas de olor y jugo de limon el mejor es el de Georgesville Square
124149619252_10153009001449253:Ran out of sofritas quite early...it would be nice if they offered the free burrito even with any other ordered meat. Since this was a promotion they should have stocked more knowing that demand would be higher.
124149619252_10151839071994253:I totally agree with Torsten. I love chipotle. But how comes the price difference? 9 is like 12$ i would get two burrito bowls overseas for one i get here. Not nice ppl. How do you explain this?
124149619252_10153009001449253:If you order 2 Sofritas entrees would you get 2 free burritos with your receipt on the next visit? Or is your receipt just act as a coupon for 1 free burrito no matter how many you purchase?
124149619252_10151024826814253:steak burrito bowl, tortilla at the bottom of bowl, white rice, black beans, corn, sour cream, cheese, lettuce with chips :D
124149619252_10153009001449253:GREEAT MARKETING! You know how many people will will participate with the intention to bring back their receipt and forget and the ones who don't forget are repeat customers!!
124149619252_10153693560944253:I have eaten at 4 or 5 of the stores that were closed and have never got sick. I will not stop eating at Chipotle it is my favorite restaurant and I don't even care if you raise prices to cover the loss of revenue for this time period I will always love the food here! Thank you for being so upfront with the process of find out what caused the ecoli it makes me respect the company even more!
124149619252_10151626575004253:there should of been a warning on this video now i want chipotle and they wont be open for 12 hours :(
124149619252_359374267426678:I definately will get this badge! Been eating their for 12 years and I'm still not tired of Chipotle!
124149619252_10153135670549253:I miss the days where employees would constantly forget to tell the cashier that there was guac under the lettuce... xD
124149619252_10153624802079253:Since your closest restaurant is like 40 mins from me, guess I will have to settle for Taco Bell today to celebrate.... ????

124149619252_10153150981964253:My husband got horrible food poisoning from the one in overland park on 95th st. Used to love it but probably won't eat there anymore
124149619252_10152406485254253:Perhaps since you have coopted Mexican food you should think of having Mexican authors as well? Just a thought... 
124149619252_10151024826814253:@Wilyamms IamDave : its like a Mexican subway... They are really friendly and will help if you don't understand. Just ask :)

124149619252_10150260445594253:Joe...want you to know that at osu cancer center in columbus ohio..there are a lot of us who crave chipotle after chemo....its a running joke among all of us...but we crave it after our treatments...
124149619252_100780796665922:They are two different restaurants; if you you want small portions and queso (BIG HINT CHIPOTLE) go to Qdoba. If you want awesome freshness and simple choices go to chipotle; I eat at both and will never choose between. I'm in the mood for one or the other its never a choice of either or.
124149619252_10152407734029253:Chipotle you just lost our family's business which was at least once a month. We still have the freedom to Not patronize your business! And Starbucks too!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Federal Way, Washington. The people there are friendly and know my order as I walk in. Now I'm hungry, thanks........

124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken burrito, black beans, fresh salsa and guacamole, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and the beautiful magic that surrounds every Chipotle
124149619252_10152773616059253:Good. I also hope you will be willing to admit most of your food is GMO. Almost all produce is these days.

124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl, white rice, beans, sour cream and cheese. Guacamole, green chile on the side and tortilla on the side. 
124149619252_10153602183249253:I don't believe it for one second. You big money corporations need to realize how bad you are affecting the community.

124149619252_10152261058584253:From all the comments above, one person is getting a free burrito. That you claimed earlier, didn't exist. Thanks a lot chipotle.
124149619252_201068089933125:I have a fantastic Chipotle near me in FL! Thank Bob!!! Wish there was one of those picnics going on here tho. <3
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito. 2 scoops of Black beans, no rice. Whole scoop of hot, half scoop of mild, big handful of cheese, half scoop of sour cream and guac (yeah I know it's extra) :-)
124149619252_10152949800154253:WOW your location at Morse Rd And Hamilton rd is beyond slow. Took me 16 min to get through line and it wasn't even to the door. No sense of urgency by any of the workers. Love the food but man!
124149619252_10152805746454253:White rice, pinto beans, steak, medium salsa, sour cream, cheese and tons of lettuce! Medium salsa & chips, and a large root beer. Comfort food yummies times infinity!  #omnomnomnom
124149619252_10151826977069253:Pobresitos no saben lo q les espera yo trabaje 4 y mi jefe. Santos  Hernandez gerente de long  island me boto como Una basura sin  desire gracias
124149619252_192398874125268:The food is amazing. Consistently amazing! Thank you Steve Ellis and thank you Steve Ellis' dad!!!! :)
124149619252_10152715839394253:Barbacoa or steak, brown rice, pinto beans, corn, sour cream, a lot of cheese, and lettuce. Personally, that is my favorite combination.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Name one food that isn't "genetically altered". I realize I'm using semantics here but that's missing the point
124149619252_520689341285681:Jessamin Rose Valdez It will be served in SF at 525 Market, 121 Fourth, 126 New Montgomery. Also both locations in San Mateo and in Millbrae and Palo Alto. - Joe
124149619252_10153009001449253:Love this offer and love your soyfritas! Will be there on Monday. Thanks for your compassionate agenda Chipotle!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl - brown rice, pinto beans, chicken, tomato salsa, corn salsa, cheese, and lettuce--about 250 times a year (including today)!
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito with chicken, rice, pintos, extra guac and sour cream, cheese, fresh salsa and lettuce. LOAD THAT BABY UP!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Fajita chicken bol with one scoop of tomatoes, two scoops of corn, sour cream and cheese....then get chips to dip in it....YUMMY!
124149619252_10153246130479253:I have said it before and I will continue saying it, Thank You! Thank You for taking this stance and leading the way. Im sure it is not easy or cheap to accomplish but well worth the effort.  I know you will be rewarded with a loyal customer base who just happen to understand the power in voting with our dollars! Trust lost is hard to get back, those companies clinging to the status quo will find this out as more and more consumers refuse to buy what they are selling. Too little too late. Again, I thank you for being bold!
124149619252_199537401806:WHAT! you are not in all states.....good thing you are in Texas, and well definitely in Colorado....Yummy burrito bol
124149619252_10152250518069253:Your receiving lots of publicity from it for free!!!! Wonder if this hoax was ment for you to have more revenue?
124149619252_10152786808474253:I kinda went a little crazy on my husband for getting a double order of carnitas before me and left none for my order!! It was devastating!! I have to have the carnitas!!
124149619252_10153246130479253:I am interested in the time machine you have, because thats the only way you're going to find genetically altered food.
124149619252_10153150981964253:I wanted to try chipolte but not even a month after they opened in amarillo they failed their health test and then the next week someone got food poisoning so I guess I won't get to eat there til I go somewhere else
124149619252_10153486712199253:they do the best burritos,and salads your way at either beef, chicken, or Veg. Pick the food you want and flavor you want it in then enjoy it .
124149619252_10151719407409253:I found this puzzle kewl because I have not seen all off them, so I looked them up, even more the reason I love Chipotle Mexican Grill
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thank you Chipotle for being willing to fight this battle - hope this will cause a chain effect in the right direction!
124149619252_10151626575004253:any burrito ordered by a real customer is not gonna look like that one she just rolled. All perfect portions and pretty. Jazmine Martinez
124149619252_10151486609219253:Nothing because there is no chipotle in Cape Coral/Ft Myers FL. The nearest one is nearly an hour away in Naples. :(
124149619252_10153009001449253:Jannon Baer, Kelly Williams, Emma Williams, Shannon Blankenship? wanna go on a date on the 26th? hehe
124149619252_156053474470:this is awesome and all but i think they are repeating what mcdonalds did in the 2000's and soon they will probably have another guy suing them. chipotle is owned by mcCdonalds anyway
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl, white rice, fajita veggies, ALL the salsas, little sour cream and cheese, lettuce... Yummy Veggie Bowl!!!!
124149619252_454413931302356:Thank you, Chipotle! I'll be coming by more often. Funny how the people who are mad at you for pulling your support of the Boy Scouts are doing what they condemn you for. smh
124149619252_10151024826814253:bol, white rice, pinto beans, barbacoa, cheese on the meat (very important), then top it off with pico!
124149619252_10153009001449253:I find your sofritas to be a bit of an interesting filling, considering they seem to be the coldest thing on Earth. Every time I have wandered into a Chipotle, I think "Perhaps this time, it will be different. I would even prefer room temperature." But alas, once I took a bite, I could never enjoy the burrito prepared for me, for the insides were colder than Antarctica. Which, incidentally, is where I am convinced you get your ingredients from.   Sorry, Chipotle, but I wouldn't buy sofritas from you (or any other food) again, even if I got it free for the rest of my life.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Frozen burritos at the grocery store are a large market. Is Chipotle going to ever make a commercial frozen food burrito line. They would be larger than the other burritos and also have a point of difference in the quality of the ingredients and the more humane free range treatment of the livestock. The current sales data of ingredients can determine the most common ingredients requested as toppings to create what the toppings would be. I bet they will sell well I want free gift cards for life if my idea is used! Ive lived on frozen burritos!
124149619252_10152560126959253:Chicken or carnitas, brown rice, pinto beans, 1/2 scoops of hot salsa, sour cream, extra cheese, and lettuce. Mmmmmmmm
124149619252_10151258924194253:Thank you for being closed on Thanksgiving.  My son is one of your employees and a full time student, and you made it possible for him to come home for Thanksgiving.  THANK YOU and Happy Thanksgiving!!
124149619252_10151879670959253:It would be great as long as that is parsley and not cilantro in the salsa. Cilantro makes me nauseous, but I can eat parsley. Is there anything at Chipotle that is cilantro-free?
124149619252_10152250518069253:PS - Joe...I wouldn't phrase things to your consumers like that "no such thing as a free lunch" as I've seen our store in Amelia Ohio do some pretty amazing things for those less fortunate. Be careful with your anger.
124149619252_365284166822162:I would order, except the last four visits I've gotten fatty and/or charred chicken in my burrito bol.  I love Chipotle, but I've learned my lesson.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Wow I almost thought you guys had done an amazing marketing job... It got me to go to your FB page and Like/follow which put you on my mind... And thinking about lunch... Even w/o a free lunch I am craving Chipotle now!! Hey wait a minute!!!! Maybe this IS the marketing ploy and it's better than I thought!!! I'm comin' in even w no free lunch!!! I LOVE CHIPOTLE!!! I LOVE YOUR CONCEPT!!! I support all you have done to support LOCAL!!! This will not change my mind about you! I am not that shallow!!!!!
124149619252_100780796665922:I like Chipotle but tend to eat more at Qdoba do to there loyalty card program.  BOGO, Burrito and drink for $5,  and other specials
124149619252_10153806089609253:I don't see a problem with anything I eat at Chipotle! I get a vegan bowl..... Bad marketing, Chipotle is a healthy version of fast food.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa bowl with brown rice, black beans, pico, sour cream, guac, lettuce. Sometimes change the meat but not the rest!
124149619252_10152028447324253:I need a corporate number or district number for the Dallas area . The store manager threw me out of the store, and refused to give it to me, when my gift card of 25 value failed to work, and I had already tipped 5$, and could have used it to pay the balance. I want my 30 dollars STOLEN from me by your chain please respond!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Carnitas bowl with pinto beans, white rice, tomato salsa, a little corn, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, sometimes guac.....then the juice from about 4 lemon wedges, and mix thoroughly, delicious!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl, white rice, fajita veggies, Barbacoa, medium salsa, cheese, lettuce, sour cream and a side of chips and Guacamole. Otherwise, its veggie bowl skip the chips and include beans and guacamole to items above. Both 5 stars!
124149619252_10153872104594253:Just like you FREE burrito giveaway.... Too short of  promotional window to text in for the offer... Boo....
124149619252_115365598544868:I love chipotle as much as the next but what I do not like is inconsitancy with the food I pay for. Went twice this week and got the same thing with two different amounts of food. We only have one in greenville sc and the lines are always long but I don't mind waiting since the food is good. If you never say anything then nothing changes.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Let's ban broccoli from stores as well since that's a man made food. And while we're at it, why not ban dog breeds since they are all genetically modified as well.
124149619252_344102858992295:Would LOVE to, but I can't justify driving 2.5 hrs for a burrito anymore :-( I wish U wld build here in Jacksonville, NC... We have SOO MANY new things going up
124149619252_10153001213604253:Wanted to say thank you for being so concerned about your pork and being responsible to not serve it. I'll be comin here more and other fast food less.
124149619252_267832333301923:I agree. Times are tough. Chipotle has always been, to my mind, a great value with a great sustainable message. This is not a great value and not a great sustainable message. The shipping on this is outrageous, and the value of the item is nowhere near the $18, charity or no.
124149619252_182076481805338:Ughh this cat drama is gettin annoying!! It's just a cat get over it!!! And if ur soo hurt mad about it get off the page!

124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken fajita burrito.  No beans.  Add corn and regular salsa, extra cheese and sc, maybe a little guac.   Yum Yum!  I order this every time!!!!
124149619252_10153530958859253:The Chipotle's in my area are all staffed by really great people, and yes most of them are teenagers or young adults. It does seem that a body piercing, streached ear lobes, or colored hair are job requirements, though! lol Doesn't matter, just an observation. They are polite and clean and customer oriented!
124149619252_228034027252006:WOW! I can't believe the passion over a burrito! do you really think Chipolte is ganna be bummed if you don't come in and buy a $2 burrito they will actually save $ by keeping your broke behinds away from there. If they had it all day do you know how many people  would go back for 2nds or go to different ones! duh!
124149619252_10152408378957741:I LOVE LOVE LOVE Chipotle Mexican Grill.  But would not exactly call it "fast" food.  Stood in line for 25 minutes Tuesday night.
124149619252_10153806089609253:My resolution is to eat more Chipotle in 2016 and spread more love to their hard working mates! ????Chipotle!!!
124149619252_194274827087:We need more in North Carolina ASAP ASAP ASAP ASAP ASAP ASAP ASAP ASAP ASAP ASAP ASAP ASAP ASAP ASAP ASAP!!!!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Let me say that again:  If Chipotle Mexican Grill were an honorable company they would turn the hoax into a real free item giveaway.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl with brown rice, veggies, EXTRA Chicken lil tomatoes, xtra sour cream and cheese. Of course i always get the bag of chips with 2 guacamoles!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Yeah chipotle you could have came out and said sorry its a hoax but we will be giving all customers 20% off there bill today through friday...you would have happier customers.  You look greedy now not wanting to hook up the people who keep you in business. Like me. See ya ill take my business to waba grill or pollo loco from now on thanks :)
124149619252_10151258924194253:Thank you for closing on Thanksgiving and giving your employees the day to celebrate with their families. :))
124149619252_205082546217004:Not when your Burrito with 13" Tortilla with Fajita vegetables, black beans, Chicken, Tomato Salsa, Corn, Red Salsa, Green Salsa and Lettuce -  has 880 Calories, 10g of Saturated Fat (50% of Daily Value),  145 mg of Cholesterol (48% of Daily Value), 3260mg of Sodium (136% of Daily Value), 102g of Total Carbs (34% of Daily Value) --- it's just a tad bit unhealthy.

124149619252_10153395310879253:To all these people claiming they will never eat at chipotle again does that mean you'll stop cheering for your favorite sports team if they support gay marriage? Love is love. Get over yourself and keep on eating chipotle. Because if you don't you'll miss out on amazing food. #LoveWon #loveislove
124149619252_10152406485254253:This business just lost my money for their high priced, high profit food for wading into politics.  Welcome all and stay out of politics.  Never again.  My family will go elsewhere.
124149619252_10153240834269253:Congrats to catering to chemophobia and the anti-GMO nuts. But, hey, I get it. Any way to profit, right? And what a better way than to charge an arm and leg off people that can be easily convinced something is evil and your overpriced food is better. Capitalism is cute when used against the nuts, and I honestly would do the same for a nice yacht and house.   Enjoy your Shamganics and salmonella poisoning.
124149619252_10151086390274253:get it girl!  Living in Berlin and dying for chipotle to break into germany.  Bring us home another gold!!!
124149619252_10151258924194253:Glad you are closed so employees can be home with their families. I am glad that Chipotle isn't like those other greedy...
124149619252_10153395310879253:I don't care who marries who.  What I care about is when a Chipotle will be established in Moore, OK. We deserve better than Qdoba, so please make it happen.
124149619252_10151058843154253:I wish it was in Denver! Though, with the power of google, it's in Gurnee, Illinois... http://www.greenbeanchicago.com/wind-turbine-green-flyash-restaurant-chipotle/

124149619252_10153405435649253:I loved this place for years since the first one opened in my home of Denver.  I now live in Cedar Park TX and my family and have eaten at the closest Chipotle in Austin hundreds of times.  We will be taking a long break after having not one but two bad experiences now.  The helpful ladies and men that used to serve us are now all gone.  Replaced with high school aged kids.  Not a problem except they ran out of beans so everyone in line waited for the beans to be made ready, as I was approaching to order they ran out of rice with none ready to replace, we waited an additional 10 mins for the rice and then I was able to order.  Now they ran out of vegies to make my borrito "fajita" style.  Agian none were cooking so I waited....... vegies are done we can complete your order sir, "oh you want steak"  They ran out and you guessed it.  I waited nearly an hour total to get my food and when I did they had the portions all wrong with too little rice mixed with too much sour cream so it was a very wet and icky combo.  I hate that they have gone so far down hill.  I will come back and i hope that they get it right because when its been good its been the best!  BTW Chipotle if you are concerned at all or listing, please clean your store, I saw liiteral fur growing on the top of the AC Chase and psuedo ceiling fan that holds the lighting for the store.  I know it is dust but obviously had not been cleaned in a year or more.  It just shows you don't care when you can't at least keep it clean where i am paying good money for your product!
124149619252_10151892810414253:Well it was fun playing every day and getting them all right anyway! Sad I'm not on the list though. :(
124149619252_10153246130479253:GMO is a loosed label term just like Certified Organics. All crops are technically GMO.  Every time an Apple tree is spliced and graft with another Apple tree. The result is a genetically altered Apple tree. When squash plant pollinated with a zucchini plant, the result is a gmo crop. That's why watermelons can't be grown within a mile from other gourd. Certified Organics means the farmer went through the USDA certification paperwork. It doesn't mean that it's any better than the local farmers market crop. It also doesn't mean the crops are free of pesticides and or herbicides.
124149619252_100780796665922:Chipotle is definitely the best restaurant I've ever been to.  However, Qdoba has truly awesome breakfast burritos and it is a lot closer to me.  However, I have only ever gotten one non-breakfast burrito from Qdoba - I will always go 20 minutes farther for Chipotle!
124149619252_199537401806:PLEASE come to Myrtle Beach, SC!!! Coastal Carolina students themselves (especially those of us from Maryland) will give you more than enough business!!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken, black beans, Fajita, salsa, cheese and lettuce...and if Im feeling naughty ill add sour cream and guacamole :P
124149619252_10153083685269253:I wish there wasn't so much cilantro in the food.  I hate cilantro.  I try picking it out but there's so much.  Please make food without cilantro.  This is why I barely go to Chipotle anymore...
124149619252_10153543212484253:This was a disaster. Everything was sold out by 1pm and the lines were ridiculous. We will never attend again.
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito. double white rice. double barbacoa.1 scoop  mild salsa, 2 scoops hot salsa, 1 scoop corn, cheese and lettuce.
124149619252_10153009001449253:My family is in the northeast corridor and expecting to get slammed with snow the next two days.  Any chance you can extend this if we can't get there?
124149619252_10150959152619253:Not anywhere close to where I live! Why not any restaurants in cities such as Baton Rouge, LA? Jackson, MS? New Orleans, LA? I can only get my fix in Houston a few times a year....... :(
124149619252_10152004082504253:Kayla Murphy - its a filler used when designing a copy or text to see what it'll look like before you actually take time ti compose and post the actual text you want to put I n. Microsoft publisher somrtimes uses this in their templates until you fill in the actual text. Chipotle either forgot to fill in the actual text before printing the bag or did it on purpose.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito Bowl: White Rice, Black Beans, Barbacoa, corn, tomatoes, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, and guacamole!

124149619252_10152093036984253:Love, love, love Chipotle, but just wanted to let you know It's ok to say you are closing for Christmas, I believe that is the "holiday" we celebrate on Dec 25.  Let's no be too politically correct, please.  Merry Christmas.

124149619252_10152599784994253:Does Chipotle use organic cilantro? I thought organic was only the beans.  Please let me know.  Thanks. Love Chipotle.
124149619252_100780796665922:Chipotle 100%!!!!  It's even better when I get it for free and I get it delivered to my house by a Chipotle worker!!!!!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Please reschedule for the Northeast. I would have gone but my nearest chipotle is 40 minutes away. Danbury, Middletown or Kingston all 40 minutes away. Believe me I go often, but it is too treacherous to drive there tonight. Besides they closed early.
124149619252_156053474470:Hope the trial works out!  We could really use this in thw Wash-MD-VA metro area!  It would put Chipotle high up there on my list ... right now I love that you can go online and compose an order that you can reuse, great feature !

124149619252_10153246130479253:Was so happy about this, and bravo, keep going. And loved the story I got on your take-out bag the other day. But according to Max Goldberg the animals you are using are still being fed GMO feed and the sodas are made with high fructose corn syrup (I'm a vegetarian and don't drink soda, so for me, your ingredients are all non-GMO - love your Sofritas with organic soy!). I do not want to be negative here, really, and I also applaud the stance you took on not buying pork not raised to the standards you established with your providers. But animals on GMO feed have gotten healthier when taken off of it and what they eat becomes what we eat, so if your suppliers are feeding their animals GMO feed, you aren't fully non-GMO with your ingredients....

124149619252_10152180797024253:There's a great documentary on Chipotle streaming on Netflix. If more people saw it they would understand why it's so important to support this restaraunt.

124149619252_10152250518069253:Well... Technically I did have a free lunch/burrito when you did the sofritas offer. But I get the point
124149619252_185864848093833:Mellissa... we arent all from the city. I grew up farming and managed a small meat farm as an adult. I have slaughtered my fair share of animals...  Youre right though... a lot of the public has no clue and its sad... They need to educate themselves... just as you need to realize Chipotle doesnt claim to be 100% organic...

124149619252_10152250518069253:It looked so fake. People need to calm down. That would be like any retail place accepting fraudulent coupons, "just because", if we all did that, we would eventually go bankrupt.  #biggerpicture
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito Bowel- Brown rice, black beans, Steak Medium, Corn, Cheese, Sour cream, lettuce. Side of guac and chip... and don't forget the water
124149619252_10150300340834253:Where abouts in DC? I live just outside of DC and some parts of it is not safe. So it all depends where if I'd go.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Bowl, white rice, NO BEANS, tomato, sour cream, cheese, and guacamole! And its half priced because i work at a Chipotle :)
124149619252_10152250518069253:No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
124149619252_10152407734029253:Too bad, you just opened a new store in Cumming Ga, and I was looking forward to eating there.   Not now-it's too inviting for someone bent on doing harm who now knows you've made the place defenseless.
124149619252_10152949800154253:Was so excited to finally have chipotle for the first time after two weeks of torture, then I see this.... ????
124149619252_10153602183249253:I love your food and everything about your restaurant. I notice that though portions are getting a little lean there is no short supply of hot sauce.
124149619252_10153888324619253:Media has blown E.Coli out of proportion. They are ruining a good company. Fyi you risk this at any restaurant.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl with white rice, black beans, barbacoa, corn salsa, grilled onions and peppers, sour cream, and cheese...mmmmm
124149619252_10153246130479253:First 'hormone free' chicken... Now no GMOs... Why not listen to science? I guess I'm not a chipotle customer any more #forscience
124149619252_10151258924194253:Thank you for supporting family time,and not making your employees work. You are a very responsible company in every aspect of doing business.
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken fajita bowl with extra veggies and salsa with guac on the side.....no cheese no sour cream, YUM-O
124149619252_10152082036279253:Chipolte is definitely not good Mexican food. It is an American man's idea on what he thinks it should taste like.  Maybe he has never eaten real mexican food.  So won't be doing the pizza either.  I want the authentic taste of Italian food and Mexican food.
124149619252_202478973111117:When u first opened in Cranberry Pa, you sent out BOgO coupons. why did  ya stop! loved them,however, it didnt stop me from coming  to Chip. when u stopped!
124149619252_10153563062919253:I don't know if you can really eat a Chipotle burrito in a car. Not enough room to really get your elbows out there. And then where are you supposed to put the guac and chips?
124149619252_10152407734029253:And please don't tell me you will be putting Mexican poetry on the toilet roll tubes or play Mariachi music after I wash my hands and use the hand blower. I want to see Mexican literature on a cup and your bags. Please don't marginalize the people that cultivated carnitas, guacamole and adobada or the people that work for you.
124149619252_10152250518069253:There used to be such thing as a free burrito... I mean It cost me about $13 dollars in aluminum foil for my burrito costume, but it was totally worth it.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl with brown rice, black beans, fajitas, pico, medium salsa, hot salsa, guacamole, and lettuce...SOOO delicious!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Rice and wheat are both GMO products.  Organic may not be as processed (there are precious few definitions of organic that people agree on), but the genetic modification is still there, regardless of processing.
124149619252_10151192106409253:it used to be come dressed in tin foil like a burrito and get one free. but i guess 2$ is not too bad.
124149619252_10152773616059253:Thank you Chipotle Mexican Grill!  Please bring ORGANIC blue chips.  We buy the bowl now but if you had blue chips that would be great!  Thank You.
124149619252_10152261058584253:Why not here in Maryland? We could use all the FREE burritos we can get considering we have the highest cost of living...
124149619252_164816057005566:What is wrong with the people saying they will stop eating at Chipotle if they ADD ANOTHER OPTION to the menu??  No one is forcing you to freaking eat it, if you don't want to. Keep ordering your dead animals (which many people find DISGUSTING), nothing changes there. But you don't want others to have more options?
124149619252_10152996855759253:Your gmo food, wait non gmo/organic, wait can you actually tell the difference or does it take a brain washed person to tell the difference
124149619252_10153514914799253:I love Chipotle but your store in Conroe, Texas received six demerits for different violations from the Health Dept. I was eating there atleast two or three times a week. Now I'm grossed out! #fixitjesus ????????????????????
124149619252_10153001213604253:" Chipotle insists on doing business only with farmers whose pigs are raised outside or in deeply bedded pens, are never given antibiotics and are fed a vegetarian diet."  I loved hearing this and I support it very much!!! ????????
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chick bowl with brown rice, pinto beans,red hot sauce, sour cream, cheese, corn, lettuce. I like me Guacomole on the side with no chips. :-)
124149619252_10151046444064253:Alexander Chechik, Brianna is correct. McD invested in us at one time, but they divested completely in 2006. - Joe
124149619252_10153009001449253:I heard the new Sofrit's are terrible and taste like nothing but salt and it ruins the taste of the rest of the ingredients
124149619252_10153001213604253:I want to do this gang!!! Tina Holt Jago Schippers Luis Miron Oscar Alvizo Pinky Alejo Ricardo Hernandez Marco Vinicio Salazar Paz Elvis L. Schippers Marwell Gutierrez if I'm missing someone just tag yourself.
124149619252_10153656854824253:Looks real good.. Tina Chen but the person who is really making that had his/her own way and hates doing it lol
124149619252_10153200118729253:And a second date, and a third date, and a fourth date, and a fifth date, and a sixth date, and a seventh date, and an eighth date, and a ninth date... repeat to infinity.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak salad.  Chips and guac.  My all time very favorite lunch.  I have the app in my phone so that I can locate a Chipotle anywhere they exist.  I've been to 20 locations.
124149619252_10153780999604253:lol lets hope the new food plan docent include Santa bringing you guys a new easy bake oven to cook in :P
124149619252_10152793161004253:Thanks for the suggestion Sarah, and in the meantime you can always ask for extra rice in the comments section at the end of your order. -Joe
124149619252_105860719543628:If this is the same ad that I've seen online it is awesome.  Love the ad and especially the Willie Nelson version of the song.
124149619252_10152262999499253:Rebecca, certified organic is gmo free.  Nice work Chipotle Mexican Grill Cultivating a better world.
124149619252_10151192106409253:Lawrenceburg, Indiana needs a Chipotle Mexican Grill... I know tons of people who would go everyday! :)
124149619252_156053474470:There are no chipotle's within walking distance of my office and we are forced to go to Cinco (reminds me of Coming to America, i.e. McDonalds-McDowell's).
124149619252_212886842115332:Thank you, Chipotle!!  Not only did we get great food for cheap, but we had fun getting dressed up to go!  You're awesome!!
124149619252_10152883478794253:Some one who goes twice a week will not be doing that now thanks for supporting your ignorant out of line employees . You guys better fix this while you still can
124149619252_10151089035244253:The Chipotle in San Jose, CA on Almaden Expressway in the Whole Foods Shopping Center. The food is great & the people are super nice & very helpful:-)
124149619252_10151058843154253:I remember when this one was built...my hubs was very excited and came home and told me all about it...(he works for Chipotle) i wish we were closer so we could check it out! ;)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa bowl, white rice, black beans, mild salsa, sour cream, cheese....chips and medium salsa....Yumus!!
124149619252_10151486609219253:Extra white rice, black beans, extra chicken, mild salsa, extra medium green, corn, a little hot salsa, and cheese, double wrapped with two bags of chips.
124149619252_10151089035244253:kensington on connecticut ave....the best man...nicest people..perfect burritos and its walking distance from my house OUSSSS
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thanks you Chipotle. We don't want GMO's in our food. Thanks for being brave and doing what is right!
124149619252_10151089035244253:New Brighton MN - they are so efficient and friendly - the line is usually out the door but I never feel like I wait in line! Food is always yummy.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Very disappointed to find these were not available in Reno, NV.  The servers looked at me like I was crazy trying to describe what a Sofrita was and your current deal to them.  Please help us... we need the good stuff too!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Today, first visit to Chipotle, read Time Mag article in this week's issue: Soft corn tortillas, chicken, black beans, salsa, fajita veggies, lettuce and I checked the nutrition calculator on your website, came in at 535 calories, 9.5 grms of fat, nutritious, delicious, the placed was well-attended around 2pm. Loved it!!
124149619252_10153232136249253:You know what else would be special? A Chipotle Mexican Grill in BGKY. Bring Chipotle to Bowling Green, KY!
124149619252_196014333852317:Same with the blacksburg location... I checked in multiple times in March but didn't get the badge. :-( It's the sole reason I joined Foursquare.
124149619252_10152935096524253:I love your barbacoa burrito, and love even more that with your app I don't have to stay in line at all. Win, win!!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Your sofritas have the most sodium out of all of the items on your menu. You need to work on that before you except people to switch over.
124149619252_10151687038594253:Preston Maki Wamsley, a burrito buck means a free burrito, not $52. the grand prize winner wins 52 burritos a year, for 20 years
124149619252_199537401806:I am trying so hard to wait until Friday to have chipotle, but burritos showing up on my page make it so hard!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Chipotle on Monday and on payday. Then a free burrito on Tuesday. Yaaasssss or yaaaassss?! ???? Leanna Morales Suzie Yang
124149619252_10150256700954253:Wow 18 thanks for serving great food and working with more organic & natural resources. That means a lot!
124149619252_10153624802079253:I feel there needs to be a comma somewhere.   I'm not eating my friends Chipotle, not even for you. Lol
124149619252_10151961054499253:Love, love, love this place!  Thanks for having brown rice available now (old news I know, but I don't come on your page to sing your praises enough)!  Please don't change anything else!
124149619252_10151486609219253:Bowl, brown rice, no beans, extra fajita veggies, chicken, tomato and corn salsas, and lots of lettuce!
124149619252_10153708605069253:Chipotle went through 2,500 tests and no ecoli was found because maybe it was never there - they are just falsely being accused of random ecoli illnesses because they went Gmo free, I smell a smear campaign.
124149619252_10152805746454253:I am getting my $3 burrito tomorrow...getting some kind of costume on and heading down to my local Chipotle Mexican Grill at 5pm...
124149619252_140229971715:I would tell you you should open one in Aspen, but then you would put our local burrito joint (The Big Wrap) out of business and that would make me sad. So put one down the road in Basalt!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl!  Light brown rice, pinto beans , fajita veggies, pico de Gallo , hot salsa , sour cream,cheese , lettuce and a side of chips = HEAVEN!
124149619252_10151486609219253:rice, chicken, fajita veggies, corn salsa, tomato salsa, hot salsa! Thanks for deciding my lunch today.
124149619252_201068089933125:We ate it for lunch and two hours later we have horrible stomach aches.  Don't get me wrong, I love Chipotle and we eat there all the time.  I'm sure it was the food, I'm just disappointed.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Just wondering if this free promo will be limited to 1 per person? Also, didn't know your sofritas used organic tofueven better! Sofritas goodnessmmm!
124149619252_10153872104594253:For the haters just don't eat there!  But know there are ppl who still eat there at there risk! I love my chipotle and have never gotten sick. Ecoli can happen anywhere and even in your own house!  Grow up ppl!
124149619252_134085872963:That was cute. Why all the negativity? At least they DID something. Keep up the good work guys and keep having fun!
124149619252_10152466066809253:That's Judd Apatow's two-minutes above Theresa, but in any case, I think it was intended to be tongue-in-cheek from George Saunders. -Joe
124149619252_10153389325099253:Well I would like to eat at the Apple valley, MN location but it's always so busy the line is always out the door... Apple valley needs another location.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito with rice, extra cilantro, double steak, pico de gallo, hot salsa, light sour cream, cheese & corn! YUMMMMY!
124149619252_10150260445594253:i go once a week and since they see my face all the time they have gave me free Burrito or tacos cards! now thats how ya do it!
124149619252_10153145422064253:Can't wait to see Twenty One Pilots! It would be awesome if you guys got Semi Precious Weapons or Nightmare and the Cat to come on that same day!
124149619252_157777224183:I could care less. You're a profit-seeking business, and there's nothing wrong with that. If you lose money on the solar power but make more profit in goodwill, more power to you. If you save money with solar power, it'll go straight to your bottom line - good on you.  I don't blame whatever you do to make a buck in business, but as a consumer I could care less where your power comes from - keep making delicious food.  The only caveat: There is a decidedly harsh backlash against the green movement - proceed with caution. Most have no problem with alternative energy in the name of economics or environmental responsibility, but if it's in the name of "climate change" or whatever they're calling it this week, beware.
124149619252_10153071188799253:Just ate there today.  Believe it or not my husband & I usually eat there 2 times a week, sometimes 3.  Kind of became addicited to Sofritas now, since carnitias are on hold.
124149619252_10153862926229253:Can you please open a Chipotle in Aberdeen MD one day? The closest one to me is like 45 minutes away and that's not even including driving back, and I love Chipotle. :(
124149619252_10153246130479253:Yeah, so somehow they are able to know if a product has gmo's when none of the producers actually have to label their gmo's lol.
124149619252_10153009001449253:No thank you !!Now you stop serving pork wants next no Beef .Are you sure you are a Mexican restaurant?
124149619252_10152406485254253:There are more f irearms  in America than there are people, and you alienated all the owners of those g uns.  Millions and millions of people.  I'm just one of those people that will no longer eating at your restaurant.  See ya!
124149619252_10153867363919253:I started my Chipotle obsession at the first one opened in Denver,Co ! When I moved to Virginia I was heart-broken you weren't here - BUT surprise, you came to Richmond - visit you often - i'm a Barbacoa, rice, black beans, corn, tomato salsa, cheese, sour cream with guac on the side! YUM! <3
124149619252_266206333465511:I wouldn't be able to check in there anyways, Chipotle is not in Pensacola, Florida. But it should be! 
124149619252_10150399959924253:I guess nobody else entered if THESE guys are the Winners!! LAME!! I agree with Cheryl...definitely a teachable moment here. 
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak bowl :) with brown rice, pinto beans, 2 scoops of the red salsa, 1 scoup of the corn, then add cheese and YUM :)
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito. brown rice, black beans, half chicken half steak, mild salsa, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, guac if feelin luxurious. Better than any other restaurant for lunch or dinner.
124149619252_10152883478794253:gee guess i cant get my chipot-name considering i only get rice and chicken and i cant skip things like salsa that i dont get
124149619252_10153867363919253:I enjoyed your CHICKEN SALAD last night with guacamole!! Thank you for ALWAYS having delicious food!!
124149619252_10153708605069253:I love you, Chipotle!  I just tried Sofritos the other afternoon, thank you for such a great vegetarian option for those days I'm not in the mood for meat! :D
124149619252_221129944611968:I love that it's so easy for me as a vegan to fill up at Chipotle.  I hope this new chain will be the same way!  (My entire fast food budget goes to Chipotle-- I don't eat at any of those other chains mentioned.  That's how I can afford it! :-)
124149619252_10152250518069253:Glad you clarified that--I couldn't find anything about it on Snopes. We had a one-time promotion in our area where a coupon in the newspaper circulars could be traded in for a free burrito, so freebies do happen, just not very often (and usually not online.
124149619252_163075200578:For all those wondering why it's not anywhere else.  It's because Texas is the shit. Move here and reap all the benefits.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie Bowl - brown rice, extra fajita veggies - black beans - Green Tomatillo - Corn Salsa - Guac - sometimes sour cream & cheese :)
124149619252_199537401806:What about the low country?! That's how I describe my mood since I moved here and found no chipotle..low.  People in Charleston live to eat... Come on with the franchise (or can I buy one?!) 
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl with white rice, black beans, corn, cheese, extra sour cream and a little bit of lettuce. I get the chipotle dressing on the side, and use it for the bowl and to dip chips in. :) yummy, now I want chipotle for lunch tomorrow.
124149619252_10153543212484253:This has nothing to do with this event, but the order ahead app needs a separate counter.  Waiting in line for these orders is getting ridiculous.  I'm typing this as I wait in line...
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl: Pinto beans, shredded beef, tomato and corn salsa, sour cream, cheese, Guac, lettuce. <3
124149619252_10153602183249253:They can say whatever the want. Every time I visit the states the first thing I do is having a burrito bowl.
124149619252_10153389325099253:I love burrito bowls...brown rice, black beans, chicken, mild and medium salsas, sour cream, cheese, lettuce!
124149619252_10153569576059253:I think it's awesome the cook has 2 full sleeves and they didn't make him hide it, they displayed it! Way to go.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Until you ensure that the chicken and beef you use were fed GMO free feed, you really can't claim that
124149619252_10151089035244253:Auburn, wa! They're so friendly!! But the ones in Olympia, wa are rude and have poor customer service.
124149619252_10153246130479253:I applaud anyone feeding people that do so to the best of their ability!  I love that a major corporation is led by what they think is right and I hope that doing what is ethical results in enough profit to attract those who are only led by greed to follow suit!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Went to Chipotle for lunch and they were out of Sofritas. Still gave everyone the deal regardless. Made my day
124149619252_10153246130479253:Oh thank you for further ensuring that only upper middle class white America can afford to eat your food because, let's be honest,  you will be raising your prices to maintain the policy change and profit level! No more need to worry about undesirables while  eating my burrito! The gentrification of fast food has finally arrived! Hallelujah!
124149619252_10151520750889253:Even if one was close, and it was open, I wouldn't go to it. Not after they pulled their funding from Boy Scouts.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa burrito with no rice, black beans, pico de gallo, salsa verde, corn, sour cream, cheese, guacamole.  Had a veggie (same burrito without the barbacoa) yesterday and today.  I always cut my burrito in half and eat one half one day and the other half the next. YUMMY!!!!!
124149619252_109031815838831:if you visit it at least once a week, you'd think you'd be able to say something nice, rather than focus on the negative.  re; article. nice.
124149619252_10152325977227741:Yes all corn is GMO. Look at the plant that corn was before humans started selectively breeding it, which is genetic modification. They said they would cut it out where they can. They could cut out corn if they wanted, but they won't because they don't want it to effect their sales. I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy of it
124149619252_10153246130479253:This is a pure marketing move that has nothing to do with food safety. Chipotle executives know this. Overwhelming data shows that GMOs are not harmful. They can and will be the way we will be able to feed the world's growing population....especially in the future where climate change will place new strains on crops.  What's next? Only unvaccinated people allowed to eat there?  Chipotle is an industry leader but they got it wrong on this call.
124149619252_10153246130479253:There is a broad scientific consensus that genetic modification is a safe and likely necessary technology for feeding the worlds growing population. As a scientist, it's sad to hear that you are placing your company in the side of misinformation.

124149619252_346503142066549:when each store has a grand opening and for the next 2-3 months, the food is amazing and then, something strange happens, it's like the managers either buy different stuff or cheaper stuff or something, but the food tastes completely different.. in every case, it's been this way, what's up Chipotle?
124149619252_10153246130479253:I have a doctor and nutritionist in my family. They both say GMO foods are hazardous to human health and the environment.

124149619252_10153009001449253:I bet like 90% of the people on here acting like tofu is gross either have never tried it or had a bad chef when they did. The sofritas are no bad tofu, they really did a good job on them. I will buy it and then use my free burrito to get more sofritas. Mmmm, delicious<3
124149619252_10153514914799253:Several people have different flavor tastes that they like or want in a burrito, and are expecting it to come out to taste.

124149619252_213189592025031:The theory of man made global warming is a fraud!  The whole movement is an marxist movement to give govenrment complete control over our economy and our lives.  There are over 14,000 scientists who have denounced the pseudoscience of "global warming" including the head of climate studies at MIT.  So on Earth Day I might eat me some Chipotle (because the food is damn good) but while I am away from home I will turn my AC on full blast and leave every incandesant light in my house turned on.  Then for good measure I might throw my gold burrito wrapper out the car window.

My only guess is that food was saved from the night before and used the next day as we were one of the first customers in Fri morning.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Guacamole stock photo By Breaking News Staff Love guacamole? Better brace yourself for this news... Chipotle said the dip could be at risk because of global climate change. News hit the web today that Chipotle said it could temporarily pull guacamole and other salsas from its menu if ingredients are affected by global climate change. The revelation came in a paragraph contained in an annual financial filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It says: "Increasing weather volatility or other long-term changes in global weather patterns, including any changes associated with global climate change, could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients... In the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients, we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items, such as guacamole or one or more of our salsas, rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients." The company told CNN that guacamole fans really shouldn't worry. "This is nothing more than routine risk factor disclosure. The sky is not falling," said Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold. "I wouldn't read too much into this." - See more at: http://m.whio.com/news/news/local/chipotle-guacamole-could-go-probably-not/nd6DR/#sthash.HUn9SIKf.dpuf

124149619252_10151719407409253:did same thing with my Mac finally got submitted after I did restart the game to fill up over again and put in right sentence way too tough here :0)
124149619252_10151089035244253:I would say Ft Myers Florida but there isn't a Chipotle there! Guess your company will get one there eventually.  We can only hope!
124149619252_134085872963:"saying "gay" when you mean "bad" just makes you look like an ignorant homophobe."  you know the video was gay. youre on facebook... youre gonna see alot of this language
124149619252_10150256700954253:Happy Birthday!! Today is my daughters 15th bday& she LOVES chipotle...any chance of a birthday bowl?!?
124149619252_10153693560944253:Keep your hot food hot. It is never above 140F. My food is often cold. No wonder you are having problems. Plus, food handlers should be touching food and food contact utensils ONLY. Food service in this country is full of people (and consumers) that believe that because they have latex gloves on, their hands are clean. Give me properly washed bare hands over that any day.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Carnita Fajita Burrita (yes, I do order it like that), with half rice, twice onions and peppers, cheese, dash of sour cream, and pico de gallo.
124149619252_182078509223:When are you going to bring something cool to Phoenix?  Or are you just going to keep teasing us with all the cool stuff you're doing everywhere else?
124149619252_10152406485254253:Gibby Sanders: Texas CHL holders go through something very similar. No more Chipotle for me. Freebird's is better anyway.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak bowl, brown rice, black beans, mild and green tomatillo salsa, a little sour cream, lettuce, and cheese.
124149619252_194274827087:need one in seville,oh. even tho theres ones in medina i dont feel like driving tht far i want one 2 minutes away not 10 lol
124149619252_10151089035244253:Been to many and the best hands down is CLIFTON, NJ! The food quality is always top notch and consistent, portions are very generous and they never skimp! It seems to always be busy there but I think that's because it's sooooo goooooddd!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl, extra rice, white or brown, no beans, chicken, green, sour cream on the side, cheese & lettuce. 
124149619252_10152250518069253:It's crazy that people are getting all worked up at Chipotle over something Chipotle asserted the company did NOT make. The sense of entitlement in this country is getting preposterous.
124149619252_213189592025031:Patrick, you're a moron for thinking that global warming is fake.  Choose to do whatever, but know that you're wrong if you believe that, and no scientist will back you up on it.
124149619252_10153246130479253:GMOs have very little to do with human health (at the moment). They represent a toxic form of agriculture that needs to be abolished. Monocropping necessitates the use of extreme inputs, so a return to non-GMO farming will aid in a replenishment of biological diversity and thus soil health. Mass produced food will never be good for people or the environment.
124149619252_10153693560944253:Love your food, but I think it will be a long time before I can trust your food safety policies again. I'll pass for now.
124149619252_100780796665922:JACK has no where near the cash flow to sustain growth from within..had to sell off other operations to focus on developing the Qdoba franchise network.  Read the 10K's of the two companies...interesting stuff.
124149619252_10150959152619253:Been there done that!  Next interesting one I am stopping at is the new one in Paris next month, turns out it is only 10 minutes from my hotel!
124149619252_10151520750889253:Because some people actually believe that Easter is a religious holiday, and they'd like to celebrate it in church and/or with their family.
124149619252_10153202946159253:This just happened to me at my credit union yesterday. Teller had "interesting" teeth. Of course I didn't ask...
124149619252_156053474470:In OhiO?  Why not start in California?  Too many peeps would be ordering delivery!!!  ESpecially in today's climate!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Beavercreek ohio !  The one in xenia ohio is terrible always have to drive an extra 20 minutes just to get good chipotle, worth it tho !
124149619252_10151024826814253:Brown rice, black beans, fajitias, chicken, pico, medium, corn, little sour cream & little cheese with lettuce! Healthy and Yummy!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Only the Monsanto shills are unhappy.Lets make them happy by labeling all gmo foods so they will be able to find their gmo's.
124149619252_10153152979994253:I would stay so long you'd have to call the authorities to have me removed or have me sign a lease. But alas there is no Chipotle near me. This doesn't stop the two hour road trips just for your wonderful burritos of the Gods.
124149619252_156053474470:OHHHH MAN, what will they think of next...This is torture to know that this might be in the future of my most favorite Resteraunt EVAR!!!!!!!!!!!
124149619252_193346814021706:@amanda: i like taco bell & i disagree.  but chipotle's price increase today did make taco bell seem 50¢ better.
124149619252_147322035888:yo you need to put  some tarentino  into your film and be more creative .. i think your clip is the work of a first or second grade film student.
124149619252_10152883478794253:Before any more idiots run in here and "OMG NO MORE CHIPOTLE FOR ME!", please read this http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/chipotlenypd.asp The whole "refusing to serve NYPD officers" meme is B.S. It never happened.
124149619252_10153001213604253:I love it! One of the best and most significant facets of humanity, working together to overcome obstacles.
124149619252_130482563683418:Jill - try to call the local branch and talk to the manager. They are the ones that have numbers to make and want to make sure their customers are happy and continue to come back. Corporate doesn't have nearly as much at stake as far as individual customers go.
124149619252_10151058843154253:Tony Ramirez That is not correct. We tested it once, but it didn't work well, and it is no longer being tested. That said, we haven't ruled out reconsidering it for the future. - Joe
124149619252_10152883505569253:Next time I go to Chipotle Mexican Grill I will meditate on this.  I am delicious limey salty chip for now and sometimes delectable sour cream is my sidekick.  Her consistency is beautiful.  I hate personalizing my food.  Can it just be my food?  I can't be creative.  Darn!
124149619252_100721619944214:Too wild!!!  LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think we might be singing the vebby song at the math lab come the end of sept. :)
124149619252_10151626575004253:The workers at the Chipotle in Clarksville, TN need to watch this. Was so disappointed in it, especially after waiting so long for one :/
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito with white rice(extra) then one serving of chicken, steak and barbocca then topped with red hot sause. Right when I walk in they know my order.
124149619252_10152949800154253:Can someone give me a number to some type of customer service? We tried the number on the site and it keeps hanging up. After talking to people that seems pretty common.
124149619252_205455487672:ok im definately gonna keep say this....VALDOSTA GEORGIA!!!!!!!!!!!!! think of america 1st then the UK.....sheesh
124149619252_10151892810414253:Took long enough. I wonder if it's going to take as long before they decide to do anything with Farm Team, as well...
124149619252_10153066985824253:When will there be a Chipotle in Red Wing,MN? There is a high demand for this franchise to come to this border town.
124149619252_117996238325437:Mike, don't forget three nights at the Sebastian Hotel in Vail and ground transportation from Denver. :-) - Joe
124149619252_10151024826814253:Of course, she works out all the time and has the metabolism of a chain saw.  And I swear to GOD (if one exists), you would think we adopted our 6 month old because she doesn't show a sign of carrying a child for 9 months...  Me I eat a chip and gain 10lbs...sigh
124149619252_10153844182544253:I think the Chipotle loyalty rewards card is a great idea. I eat the chicken burrito bowl every other day.
124149619252_10152323527922741:I just watched Inside Chipotle, too. I loved Chipotle before, but now I love it more.  Steve Ells, I am glad you decided to expand your Chipotle kingdom instead of opening a fancy, fine dining establishment!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Wow there's a lot of places that give out free food and drinks few times a year, so there is such thing as "free" lunch/breakfast/dinner/drinks etc.  But it's a shame you don't appreciate customers that much:/
124149619252_10152251259784253:Can someone define LA "Area"...seems that if we can drive to every home game we live in the LA "Area"
124149619252_10152250518069253:lol.  I don't think it's stupid to believe.  It could bring a lot of people into the restaurant that have never tried the food before, like me.  Also, coupons are not unheard of.  How many millions of coupons are there circulating right now??  So, I think that it would be good for Chipotle to honor this offer, instead of calling potential patrons stupid for believing this.  I was going to try Chipotle tomorrow because my professor recommended it, however, I changed my mind. Not for the fact that Chipotle won't honor it, but for insulting those who read what looked like a real coupon.
124149619252_10151892810414253:I signed up for Farm Team and was told I'd get a free t-shirt or a burrito, just for signing up.  Never saw where to claim.
124149619252_10153602183249253:There is no way Chipotle or any other corporation would use this as an advertising campaign. Shame on anyone
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl, extra white rice, sometimes half white/brown (always extra), fajitas, chicken, little corn, little green, extra sour cream, cheese, guac, and lettuce.
124149619252_228034027252006:Here is a thought..it is charity. Something you do for a cause you believe in. If you do not want to participate then don't...that is your choice. But Farm Aid not only helps the hungry it also helps the farmers out there who are not willing to let quality over quantity win. SO please remember that Chipotle was founded on a simple concept with quality ingredients. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!!
124149619252_10150300340834253:Hopefully you're hiring someone to work on your website. Right now it's just a directory that's open to browsing!
124149619252_10151826977069253:aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh ohmein goooooooottttttt auch noch frankfurt als wär mein wunsch einfach in erfüllung gegangen..aaahhhhhh habs grad erst erfahren..MORGEN STEH ICH AUF DER MATTE
124149619252_10153112208029253:May I suggest a location in Warren County? There are VERY few Mexican restaurants and so many Mexican food cravers in that area. You could increase your profits. Eh?
124149619252_10153388589524253:Don't change anything... Just add options!! Just have a whole separate section for vegan & gluten free and put pork back in my beans and put non pork beans in that back section too... Please don't take anything else away!!!
124149619252_215673425111837:My wife and I have been watching that "Next Great Restaurant" show and the only thing I've really learned about this guy is that he's a jerk.
124149619252_164816057005566:Benjamin Cady, we are currently testing it in San Francisco. Fingers crossed the test goes well. We will then see if it makes sense to expand it. -Myra
124149619252_10153246130479253:Yay!   GMO is mostly about companies wanting to patent  something, so they can control and profit.  Its not about quality.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Kate Hearn. I'm only excited that im counting down the days until I eat a delicious burrito. 4.5 more days!!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Told everyone I know about this AND brought a co-worker with me. Waited half an hour in line and the woman before me got the last of the Sofritas. The workers told me they were totally out (and no more to come, I presume). VERY poor planning on a day when you're offering a Sofritas promotion. This vegan is NOT happy at all!
124149619252_10152250518069253:That was quite RUDE! You could have started with a apology for the mix up or something of that nature! I have been a loyal customer since 2007. I love Chipotle and will continue to go there, but just thought the post could have been worded a little better.
124149619252_10153872104594253:Katelyn Wunderlich Taylor Sgalia ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
124149619252_10151089035244253:not in panama city, panama!!!! chipotle therefore sucks.. havent you heard about panama.. idiots i swear!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:steak rice bowl, fajiata vegetables, pinto beans, alot of cheese, alot of sour cream, tomatoes, and lettuce...and of course Guacomoloe and sometimes corn
124149619252_10150719072154253:Suzanne, just so you know, McD invested in us during our middle period up until 2006, but then they divested completely when we went public in January of that year. That is all. - Joe
124149619252_10151719407409253:I am using Firefox and I had to refresh the page while on the puzzle and re-input my answers. Then it let me submit
124149619252_100780796665922:hate Qdoba <3 Chipotle... both unhealthy even if you order the "right" things... so I don't go to either of them anymore.
124149619252_10152323527922741:Really? Yet you are selling conventionally raised products in your restaurants right now!! Don't bite the hand that feeds.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I won't be setting foot in any of your restaurants again. Removing pork dishes from your menu so not to offend certain "religious" groups offends me. Bye
124149619252_10152786808474253:I'll take a chicken burrito, LIGHT white rice, black beans, sour cream, corn, MORE sour cream, MORE corn(tastes better in that order), and finally cheese. Plus a Mr. Pibb/Pibb xtra
124149619252_10151486609219253:Barbacoa, brown rice, black beans (lots), medium salsa, sour cream, and cheese with guacamole on the side.
124149619252_10151024826814253:1/2 &1/2 Carnitas and Barbacoa, Black Beans, Veggies, Pico, Corn, and Roja salsa, sour cream, cheese, lettuce.
124149619252_153487264707094:Please come to Prattville, Alabama. Great location for you and you'd pull allot of folks from Montgomery!!!!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Could you guys get a salsa that is mild but, doesn't have tomatoes in it like you pico di gallo? My husband can't handle the spicy medium green salsa but he doesn't like the mild pico di gallo.
124149619252_10153246130479253:I support this. Science has yet to validate the efficacy and safety of GMO's consumed by humans long term (Not interested in being a lab rat, thanks). Until that day, I will continue to keep myself and family as far away from GMO's as possible.
124149619252_10152786808474253:If they aren't going to have carnitas they should give us another non spicy choice. Everything is too spicy for my kids now. ????
124149619252_100780796665922:Totally agree. My husband and I both like the burrito bowl which we always share as it's too much for one person. What's nice is if I don't want sour cream and he does, they will put it on 1/2 of the bowl. Go Chiptole!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito with: Brown rice, black beans, x-tra mild salsa, dash of hot salsa, cheese(little x-tra please), fajita. Veggies & x-tra sour cream!  Wrap it up & get in ma belly!
124149619252_10153009001449253:So if I buy anything or that softerita thing I can just show any chipotle the receipt around 27th to 28th of February ans get a free burrito looks like I'm heading to different chipotles between those times XD
124149619252_10152949800154253:Hi, just wanted to say that I love your food, okay with that said I have to say the Irving Texas location on beltline rd has to be the worst location ever, every time my family and I go there they run out of something, or just won't cook more of something because they close in 30 minutes. The last time I went there it was 45 minutes before they closed they were out of corn, onions and bell peppers, chicken and black beans, the funny thing is that was most of the stuff I wanted. Myself being in the service industry understands about wanting to go home as soon as possible after work or have a drink or two. But I also know that this would be unacceptable in the establishment that I work at. In short my family and I will never go back to the Irving Texas location on Beltline witch is sad because we live so close, but I guess we'll have to drive to the Las Colinas location Instead to see if they can do any better. Thank you for letting me rant, I love your food. Hate that location.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Chipotle, how can you claim 100% or all food GMO free?  Forget the drinks for a minute, but your chicken and pork are still technically by all anti GMO peoples definition not GMO free.  If you simply were upfront and stated you changed more things to be GMO free you wouldn't getting as much flack.  That fact that you choose to basically like, or best case mislead with your 100% GMO free statement shows us this is nothing but a marketing ploy.
124149619252_10152883505569253:Your employees should just serve those overpriced burritos and refrain from their moronic politcal viewpoints.
124149619252_10153135670549253:Come to Western Mass. You would kill it here. There's not a chipotle closer than an hour drive but it's always worth it
124149619252_10151086390274253:great idea but also possibly a terrible idea. if she loses because of too long of a time out as a result of massive defecation, I wouldn't be surprised
124149619252_160584150738666:How about one in Montgomery? Actually, no. I'd settle for one in prattville or Wetumpka! They're nicer anyway.
124149619252_10153830182809253:Chipotle to close all stores on Feb. 8 for all-staff meeting on food safety https://www.trendster.fr/chipotle-usa/
124149619252_10151058843154253:The turbine on top of this paricular restaurant is convenient in that this Chipotle can actually morph into a hovering battlestation. The only above ground section is the innocent-looking burrito bistro, but under the earth lies a gargantuan war machine equipped with enough fire power and fuel to hold all of Venezuela at seige until the year 2035.
124149619252_10153088156639253:Let's open Chipotle in the Conyers,Covington, Decatur,Lithonia, Stone Mountain area. That's Georgia baby 30016,.
124149619252_10151089035244253:The best one I ever went to was in LONDON!  I lived in England for two years and the London location opened the summer before we moved back to the States.  I waited in anticipation but it was SO WORTH IT!!!
124149619252_10152805746454253:Brown rice, bell pepper fajitas, black beans, barbacoa, pico de gallo, red salsa, crema, corn, guacamole, cheese, lettuce all in a bowl. Yummy!!!!
124149619252_10152883478794253:Adios Chipotle.  Qdoaba just picked up a customer.  Hell I'll now choose Taco Bell over Chipotle too.
124149619252_10150399959924253:sounds like everyone on here asking what this is supposed to be ...arent HUUUUGGEE fans of chipotle...it's only like the character out of the COOOLEST commercial out there...!!!
124149619252_10153232136249253:Too bad Wall Street didn't love  your lack of carnitas in stores lately today.  Ouch!  I still love you, though....and even more since you rid our N. Canton location of the $&?.; manager a few months back.  Thanks!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl Black beans*white rice*green peppers & onions*corn*mild salsa*sour cream*cheese*extra lettuce.......(scrumptiously delicious)!
124149619252_10153896327714253:seriously, make me double over in pain again. ill still eat there. you and wendys. she never poisoned me though. chipotle is a subtle mistress indeed...
124149619252_10152805746454253:Burrito. No rice. Steak. No salsa. Cheese. Sour cream. Guac. Small order of chips and a drink. I may be kind of bland but the steak makes it tasty. I'm in heaven. :)
124149619252_10153693560944253:I'm really not surprised this happened. I've been avoiding Chipotle for about a year now. The last time I went, I cut my burrito in half to start eating it only to find bugs crawling in it. I almost threw up right there. When I complained, the employee had the nerve to tell me it was because the lettuce was organic. You've never heard of washing lettuce? It was only a matter of time before this happened. Perhaps it as good thing and Chipotle will now change there ways, and maybe force others to change there's as well. Either way, i'm glad I wasn't eating there when this outbreak happened. I wonder if the one near Pike Place Market (the one this happened at) was closed found to have contamination. I would not be surprised at all. None of my friends, or people I work with, that I've told about this will even go near that place now, so I didn't need to say I told you so.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Half Steak, half Barbacoa, brown rice, black beans, mild salsa, hot salsa, cheese, lettuce, and guac.
124149619252_10152325977227741:There is nothing wrong with GMOs. This is just an idiotic idea people have gotten into their heads. You eat GMOs everyday. Bananas, cutie oranges, seedless watermelons and the list goes on and on. Chipotle is trying to bring down agriculture. This is very scary to me. We are already having trouble feeding the world as it is and the population is expected to double its self in a few years. Make your owns decisions people. Don't be persuaded by people who have never even stepped foot onto a farm or worked with an animal.
124149619252_202478973111117:Interesting... will this be the golden burrito like the golden ticket of Willy Wonka? Is there a prize inside (besides the burrito)?
124149619252_228303190552746:It looks like we'll just need to agree to disagree then in our approach. Best of luck to you sir and the farming systems you prefer to support! - Joe
124149619252_10153656854824253:Hee trabajado en chipotle 3 años y se todas las resetas es lo mejor q puede aver se me antojaria un burrito boll
124149619252_10152323527922741:For those who believe that this video is not true. Go ahead and continue to eat your food grown by modification using pesticides, herbicides, fungicide, and go blindly as Monsanto is beginning to build a product where food is resistant to Agent Orange. If you want to eat it, go right ahead. I choose, however, to not be blind to the fact that this video is very real.
124149619252_10151024826814253:The Barbacoa Bowl - Little Brown Rice, Pinto Beans, Barbacoa Meat, Corn, Cheese, Guacamole for $1.00 extra :(, and green salsa on one side and spicy red sauce on the other.
124149619252_10152357093419253:My nasty burrito that sat in the counter for over 30 minutes while you guys prepared a friends we'll done meat. One of my worst experiences ever. Can't wait for Tacobell to start putting up u.s tacos everywhere
124149619252_10152560126959253:My order - either a barbacoa or carnitas burrito with sour cream and cheese only. I use hot sauce that I have at home to dip it in (don't care for theirs). Don't care for rice or beans on burritos and I don't like veggies. :P
124149619252_10151486609219253:Whole wheat tortillla, brown rice,black beans,fajitas, corn salsa, pico, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, and guacamole. :D
124149619252_10152407734029253:Hey Mr. Chipotle, you kinda forgot that Mexican authors exist. So I will give you a little time to get aquainted with their work and decide who to put on your "cultivating thought" cups. Until then I will eat at Burrito Express down the street. 
124149619252_10153389325099253:Last time I had Chipotle they didn't give my girlfriend enough chicken in her burrito and there was a hair in her side of sour cream. Employees didn't even apologize for everything. It was the last and final time I go to Chipotle. I'm going to Qdoba from now on.
124149619252_10152773616059253:seems they figure they'll side with the money & corps. Too bad. Those of us in Tucson always wonder how anyone could eat at a Chipotles - there's Mexican food everywhere.
124149619252_10153734396969253:I'm getting sick of your guys customer service in Lancaster California. Your chef just threatened me in front of a manager and the manager did not care. Even as I walked out and told another customer about the service he stated that they are always rude, Which they are. I'm getting sick of this and your corporation needs to do something before i bring in the attorney general on his situation.
124149619252_10153150981964253:Chipotle I love you I do so wish you would mix my food prior to rolling my burrito! This would save me from getting a bowl with tortilla on the side.
124149619252_10152408378957741:The fact that this picture has the extras in the reverse order from what they are at my usual Chipotle weirds me out. Is that a bad sign?
124149619252_213189592025031:Because Earth Day is NOT about global warming! Its about taking care of that planet on which we live! And people like who who try to take these true meaning and look further into reate ignorance and stupidity in people. THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO EARTH DAY THEN TO SUPPORT THE IDEA OF TAKING CARE OF OUR PLANET. Ya know, cause we wouldnt be here if it wasnt for the planet? Like Ive said FOUR times. But again, your stupidity is too thick to realize it? And not just you, Patrick, but every one who feels Earth Day is a government conspiracy or anything like that. Some one earlier said it right, (
124149619252_163198123842255:Anxiously waiting for the Grand opening of the Palm Bay location.    Mmmmmmm my mouth is watering......mmmmmmmm
124149619252_10153806089609253:Really chipotle. Just got a burrito bowl with beans that came with no beans. How do you forget to add the beans. Was going to post a pic but it doesn't give me the option
124149619252_205455487672:This is great news!! I would love to know who is teaming up with you guys over there in order to bring your more ethical approach to the food industry in the UK. 
124149619252_10153395310879253:Lighten up! They are showing their support ???? We don't always have to pick apart others' sense of humors. Choose to see the good ????
124149619252_10152408378957741:Every restaurant should be set up like chipotle - lol.  Its hard to sit down and get waited on by a wait person now - we go there a few times per week.  There is an italian place set up like it in detroit that is great too.  Always packed.
124149619252_10152632602189253:Here's to the one who first introduced me to Chipotle and started my love affair with those massive burritos... Wesley Keith Godby
124149619252_10153872104594253:I stopped going there a long time ago because the flavor of the food was not there.  something changed.
124149619252_10153001213604253:I have just read that you will not be using pork at a third of your establishments, losing considerable money and creating no end of trouble for you. Apparently because you care that much about the humane treatment of pigs (and no doubt other animals). I live in Germany and have never heard of you before (no disrespect- you're just not in the area) but I am so impressed. THANK YOU
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Burrito, Lime Rice, Black Beans, Sour Cream, Mild or Hot Salsa, Cheese, Lettuce, Coke Zero... BOMB!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Came in to get Sofrita and it's all out!!! It's not even 6:30, no rain check, nothing!!! What kind of promotion is this? Very disappointed!!!
124149619252_10150260445594253:Punch cards aren't gimmicks! They're INCENTIVES! I have a Mission Burrito across the street from Chipotles and when I can go there and buy 9 burritos and get the 10th free or go to Chipotles where there's no incentive... and I'm buying 35-50 dollars worth at a time, it would be worth it to have a punch card. It gets expensive.
124149619252_10152406485254253:People that fear guns so much deserve McDonald's.  Keep up the good work chipolte. Don't cave to these libtard cows.
124149619252_492523374093310:please get help, chipotle addiction will do more harm than herion addiction, i know i have worked at chipotle and am a recovering herion addict.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak Burrito Bowl: brown rice, black beans, fajita peppers&onions, pico [de gallo], hot sauce, cheese and shredded lettuce! Perfection! Y'all need a Chipotle in Galveston, TX... make it happen!
124149619252_10153693560944253:With the recent outbreaks in Ohio...it says Akron area restaurants can you be a little more specific??
124149619252_10152250518069253:Lol. Gloria Sanchez. I reposted because Juana Langarica reposted.  Yo dije si una gm lo hace pues es cierto. Lol. Lol.×3.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Burrito Bowl w/white rice & pintos,all three salsas,and EVERYTHING else,and yes I know it's $1.80 extra for da guac.... & sooooo worth it...mmmmmmm :p
124149619252_10153200118729253:Jon Badmuthatrucka Mendez Remember when we started dating, u asked where I wanted to go eat and I said, Chipotle!
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito bowl, white rice, steak, corn salsa, extra cheese and sour cream....with chips for dipping like nachos.
124149619252_10151024826814253:All of your comments are making me starve over here in Colonial Heights, Va.  We have to drive 28 minutes to the nearest Chipotle.  And yes we do!  It's the best there is!
124149619252_10153166302899253:it's 5:44 am and i am craving chipotle so badly u dont even understand & i'm still waiting for u to claim the 3 i owe you ahhhh Constance Wang
124149619252_10153236016399253:Suggestion! Can you come up with some more options for those of us who don't like cilantro? For several people it tastes like soap. Right now the only salsa I can eat is hot & it's too spicy. Also a cilantro free rice option would be great as well.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Prediction: short term burst of sales from fraud babe army and their ilk, followed by dragging sales because orthorexics don't actually 'do' fast food...
124149619252_10151024826814253:14+ years ago I first tried Chipotle.  Yummy.   Bowl, light brown rice, fajita, Black Beans,  chicken and  Barbacoa, mild Salsa, Big scoop of Hot, cheese and lettuce.  yum.  
124149619252_10151058843154253:Gurnee IL, Not only does it have a windmill. The roof collects rain water to water the grass.  Most of the store was made of recycled material.  Energy saving lights.
124149619252_205082546217004:I recall reading that McDonald's used to earn a portion of Chipotle shares but had since sold those shares. 
124149619252_10153246130479253:but the food is still full of GMO's unless you can afford to feed your live stock with non GMO's also. you are basically lying to people

124149619252_10150262089049253:what the white stuff around the plants?  I live in Ohio and it's in the 90's so I know it's not snow!
124149619252_10151089035244253:We love all your locations!!  But one of our faves is in Stuart FL.  Always so friendly.  And always fresh and delicious!
124149619252_10153395310879253:This is in celebration of Gay Pride week! It is meant to embrace and people are taking it in the wrong context. Lighten up! Have fun & enjoy a burrito for goodness sakes!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito, white rice, black beans, pico (mild salsa) cheese and sour creme!!!!! Best stuff ever!!!
124149619252_10152082036279253:pizza from chipotle?!?!? oh my god! this has the potential to be one of the greatest things this country has ever done, next to women's suffrage and the civil rights movemnt and stuff, but other than that....
124149619252_10153112208029253:I could eat Chipotle everyday! I would aternate between Crispy Chicken Tacos, Steak Fajita Bowl & a Barbacoa Burrito. Of course you have to get all their delicious fixings (pico, corn, hot salsa, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce & lots of cheese!) Ok, now I am starving. lol
124149619252_10151024826814253:What I eat three times a week, A bowl with white rice, steak, every type of salsa, Little bit of sour cream, guac and lettuce. Always juice a couple lemons on it, too (: Favorite meal
124149619252_156053474470:Holy crap! I used to be the Faxpiditer at the Chipotle in Lakewood, Ohio. As if "Fax In, Pay Up, Walk Out" wasn't bad enough... Now you have door to door service! I almost feel bad for the drivers... I just hope they're alowed to take tips... Actually, I lied... I feel bad for the line ppl and the grill guys! Business is gonna BOOM BABY!!!
124149619252_182078509223:Nothing is better than meat.. But I have lots of friends who don't eat it... Do them a favor and bring it to Sacramento, ca... I might even try it too
124149619252_10152408378957741:Quite a few places are set up like Chipotle the way they serve things. Maybe I should go visit a Chipotle sometime soon. I haven't had their food in over a year.
124149619252_10152004082504253:Yayy I'm so happy about this for some reason now the 4 years of Latin I took don't have to go to waste haha :)!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:The burrito bowl, brown rice, black beans, barbacoa, cheese, corn, sour cream, lettuce, and hot salsa!!!!!
124149619252_322643590240:can't wait til december or january when we finally get one to open here in western new york.  it may be 45 minutes away but well worth it.  hope they open one soon after south of buffalo.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I had the tofu sofrita burrito bowl today and it made me so so sooo sick . This is such a disappointment I think it may have ruined chipotle for me. BEWARE THE SOFRITA
124149619252_10151024826814253:barbacoa burrito: white rice, pinto beans, medium salsa, extra sour cream and cheese. shouts to mark working at chipotle and rochester!!
124149619252_185864848093833:no food can hurt you if your mind is healthy, i have a buddy that eats only fast food, and he is perfectly healthy, one of the strongest people i know mentally
124149619252_10151839071994253:I compare them because they both are vegan friendly, healthy, and do not upset my stomach. Chipotle is definitely overpriced but that wont stop me from going there. :))
124149619252_10153262094399253:Jolisa Miller, ha I literally saved that recipe an hour ago???? I bet your gonna whip up a batch for supper tonight????
124149619252_228303190552746:Love Chipotle, your ingredients taste so much better than any fast food place I know....make more restaurants :))))  
124149619252_100780796665922:There's a battle? Chipotle may have less options but their food is of much superior quality and taste. Qdoba is just a few steps ahead of Taco Bell with Alpo not far behind either.
124149619252_156053474470:Colin, you have made my day!!  How lucky I am to work in Columbus, Ohio!!  I am hooked on Chipotle!!  We will definitley be ordering in!!
124149619252_10151058843154253:Don't know where it is but it won an award for being solar and wind powered -- the first of its kind!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Mankato, Mn where I met my husband and the one closest to MSP where we'd go after I'd pick him up from his military leave! :)
124149619252_10152883505569253:Do not buy the humane lie! Chipotle claims to serve "food with integrity"and treat animals with "dignity and respect". But the animals they exploit are living, feeling individuals just like you and I, and they are brutally killed simply for being born different than us. There is nothing humane about removing animals from their natural environments, separating them from their families, putting them into cages, mutilating their bodies, and ultimately killing them. People generally do good and have big hearts, but sometimes our world tricks good people into doing bad things. The land that would become America had a proud tradition of slavery for 400 years. I think you know that this is wrong, and that it is wrong to oppress another living, feeling individual simply for being different. So please, make a stand for the animals. They need our voice. Do not buy Chipotle's lies. IT'S NOT FOOD, IT'S VIOLENCE!
124149619252_10152406485254253:Are we getting new cups and bags??? We've had the same ones for like 3 years now. I Love reading them and I wish we got new ones more often.
124149619252_100780796665922:We eat at chipotle atleast once a week!! We love it! It is definatley the best! Qudoba is awful! Yuck!
124149619252_10152738663064253:Was wondering if I could copy and paste this pic as my profile pic... Love chipotle and everyone who knows me knows that
124149619252_10152236327209253:When will we get the sofitas in the NW? I want to be able to eat at Chipotle with my husband the vegan.
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken burrito or bowl, extra rice, sometimes fajita veggies, mild salsa, corn salsa, sour cream, cheese and guac.  chips and guac on the side.  mmmm...
124149619252_10152314382492741:If I were still a pork eater, I'd be eating the free-range variety. I detest factory farming. It's cruel and barbaric. I can't wait to see a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Valdosta, GA... I LOVE Mexican food, especially fresh and healthy the way you make it :-)
124149619252_10153240834269253:hope y'all enjoy your new yachts or whatever from this simply brilliant, but over used and highly misleading marketing ploy
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl with rice, black beans, steak, extra cheese, pico, sour cream...AND always the chips with lime salt! Love Chipotle!!
124149619252_10153431912459253:I order me 3 Steak Tacos and a Double steak and chicken Burrito every trip.. can't help it.. LOVE IT!!!
124149619252_10150300340834253:All I get is errors when I try to look at the website to find its location... What's the deal Joe? What's the location? When does it open? I am interested in trying it out.... What's on the menu?
124149619252_10151024826814253:I feel like Chipotle Mexican Grill will not see my previous post due to all the actual food replies....
124149619252_10152949800154253:^^^ I think you should post this link directly to your facebook page. my husband and I love Chipotle and eat there often.  But when we first found out about this incident, you lost our business.  My husband is a sheriff's deputy, so we were happy to find out that it was an individual action.
124149619252_10153240834269253:Does anybody read beyond the title anymore? If you did half of these comments and questions wouldn't be here. http://chipotle.com/gmo
124149619252_10152992584389253:Thank you for having morals and standing up against animal cruelty. You guys ROCK! I will be buying Chipotle for lunch today. ;)
124149619252_10153246130479253:Other countries label GMO's at no additional cost to the consumer, why can't the US? Answer: we can but our government has been bought by the biotech industry not too.
124149619252_10151892810414253:Yay! I'm a WINNER!!! A Big Thank You from the bottom of my heart CHIPOTLE!!! This is an answered prayer from Jesus. You are my familys favorite restaurant. ?????????
124149619252_10151961054499253:Who cares about gmos. 98% of chipitles customer base is there for the food. Not to cry over gmo nonsense. If we did we might as well eat a cardboard box.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Except if in NYC and they only made enough sofritas to last 30 minutes.... False advertising... Come on guys.
124149619252_156053474470:Wish I lived in Columbus Ohio!!! We need more Chipotle's out here near me.....and if it delivered, that woudl be great!!! I love Chipotle's.
124149619252_10151089035244253:The BEST Chipotle location is at 88th/Wadsworth in Westminster.  They have the friendliest crew, cleanest restaurant and I love going there!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito, fajita vegetables, rice, pico, medium green salsa, lettuce and cheese.  Then chips w/medium salsa.
124149619252_10150399959924253:I wish there was a description of what they are.....how are these the winning costumes when we can't even tell what they are!?
124149619252_10153246130479253:What's wrong with GMO? Lmao GMO doesn't have to be bad, it could be modified to be more nutritious or just better looking (food looks healthier itself).
124149619252_10151089035244253:My favorite place to eat is Chipotle in Secaucus, NJ. The employees are very kind with their servings, cleanliness is never to be worried about here because the restaurant is well taken care of. The hip and jazzy music really sets the mood for a dish best served at Chipotle!
124149619252_10152407734029253:You know what would be a good idea? Including Mexican authors in this project! You know, since Chipotle is supposed to be Mexican-style food...
124149619252_109031815838831:I agree with the "build one in Corpus Christi, TX" post. I have been known to drive all the way to San Antonio just to eat at Chipotle!
124149619252_10153693560944253:I want to chime in and say that I admire the forward thinking that Chipotle displayed during this trial. Thank you for taking swift action to ensure your brand maintains its integrity by doing the right thing. As director of operations for a strong NW brand, your caution is respected and your honesty admired. Thank you for making the tough decisions to keep the public safe.
124149619252_10153423452749253:Nice last year and kids had a great time.. T-shirts plants and pots for them to grow there own tomatoes and veggies.. Free food for them!!!
124149619252_182078509223:Really nice ... DC is soooooo lucky!!  Please spread the love to Northeast Ohio!  We love you too, Chipotle!
124149619252_10152108930454253:I just want to say...that as a raw vegan, there are very few places I can go out to eat. HOWEVER, Chipotle is my go-to & I would go there every day even if I wasn't a raw vegan. Y'all are so nice, hilarious, friendly, helpful & the food is top-notch...oh, and lemon wedges = game-changer. Tonight, I braved -10F to get my vegetarian salad bowl & I would do it again if I had to. It's just. that. good. Just wanted to say thanks for consistently offering the best food & service around (no matter the Chipotle I visit)! Love you guys.
124149619252_140229971715:y'all should make it an annual thing. like choose 5 states and assign them a month, then have 2 months of just regular sales everywhere.
124149619252_240071849428248:Ive missed chipotle so much, ive been in japan the last 2.5 years and now im finally back i plan on making up for what i missed
124149619252_163075200578:u guys need to bring this deal to the metro area in dc!!!!! i eat there every other day and deserve a free meal!!!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Wonderful marketing ploy. No basis in fact, reality or actual sustainability or health benefit, but a wonderful marketing ploy indeed.
124149619252_10152108930454253:We need a location in Pflugerville, Texas at the Stonehill center. I would do it, but yall don't franchise. You will thank me if you build one. About to be a water park a mile away and it's across from a high school. $$$ all day, please Chipotle, come this way.
124149619252_10151089035244253:Was the Hamilton Rd/Morse Rd location but the Service has gone down so bad I drive 5 miles down the road to the Easton location where the Service is 100% better.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Also, thank you Chipotle for doing this! If this can change the way even one person consumes meat then I would call it a success!
124149619252_10153009001449253:I'm not gonna lie, the Sofritas IS bomb!!! This is coming from someone who's more carnivore than ANYTHING! LOL
124149619252_10153467418504253:Chipotle has some of the food that customers like to eat missing so they can't be put in the burritos or the salads in the places to make you food and take togo.
124149619252_10153389325099253:Meridian, Idaho and I had to blow my NO OIL vegan diet because there is oil on the rice, beans and sofritas :( I miss Chipotle too much.
124149619252_10152325977227741:@trishwright Yes they are all GMOs believe it or not. (Bananas originally had seeds. Today they do not thanks to agricultural scientists.)They weren't originally that way and there is no need to put farm in quotations. I interned on a large scale hog operation and have raised pigs for 5 years. I am also completing my bachelors in a agricultural field. Believe what makes you happy I suppose. You obviously don't want to believe the people that actually work in the industry.
124149619252_10151719407409253:you have to answer every word correctly and make sure you use two different "they" and  wide and Wider
124149619252_10153532724474253:I visited your location in Southfield, MI on Telegraph Rd, worst restaurant experience of my life, however, one employee made it a lot better and I appreciate him for that.
124149619252_194274827087:I have been living in England for 3 mos and am in serious withdrawls, I would possibly kill for a Chipotle Burrito right now...
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie burrito with white rice, black beans, fajitas, tomato, corn, guacamole and lettuce and a large iced tea with lemons in Secaucus, NJ. My favorite!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Never eaten here and never will! Does everyone realize the amount of calories in one meal???  I think that's what you should worry about!
124149619252_10152082036279253:Come to Mountain Home, Arkansas!! Haven't had Chipotle in 2 years since the nearest one to us is hours away. :(
124149619252_10152990683604253:Chipotle way to go on getting rid of the pork!! Wish you did it for EVERY restaurant. Please make it permanent!
124149619252_10153388589524253:If you're seriously interested in making quality tortillas on a large scale, the take a look at the method employed by Taco Cabana in central Texas.  They hands down make the best tortilla of any quick service restaurant out there.  Just saying...  I am Mexican.  Lol
124149619252_10150260442884253:I recognize the guy with the red bowtie from an episode of Your Ohio. You're at The Chef's Garden, aren't you? :)
124149619252_10153246130479253:I never ate there before because it was so unhealthy but now that you've switched to healthy organic non GMOs, I'm going to eat there every day!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Did I really read that someone called a TV station to talk about a company not accepting a fake coupon? And they didn't get a discount..for what? being gullible? Please. I guess in that case we should all just start making our own fake coupons and demand they be offered because 'it was on the internet'. Off to make my "100% free 2014 BMW' coupon now....
124149619252_10151719407409253:Lmao... Definitely need to lengthen the time out on the log in If the puzzles are going to take this long to fill out!!! ....
124149619252_10152992584389253:Ah man! Y'all are killin' me. DC is a bop and don't even get me started about the driving and especially parking.  I'm so much closer to the new location in Columbia, MD @ the mall. My heart is breaking. =(
124149619252_10151024826814253:Salad.  Brown rice, black beans, fajitas, chicken, tomatoes, corn, just a little bit of cheese & sour cream.
124149619252_10152781317704253:What a GREAT event... My new favorite is the Kale Salad!!!!!! please bring that to your stores!!!!!!!!!!!!! #ineedthatinmylife
124149619252_454413931302356:ditto with steve smith.  I'm sorry too, happened to really love your burritos, and my whole church comes to your store almost every Sunday!  Why was it when Chik-a-fila takes a stand and there was a boy-cott, but now if BSA takes a stand, Chipotle pulls its sponsorship, so if Christians boycott it is considered bigotry, but when others boycotted Chik-a-fila it was not???  double standards here ...
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl! Brown rice, black beans, carnitas, hot sauce, sour cream, lettuce, cheese, and lots of Tabasco sauce. Mmmm....
124149619252_10151855292469253:Mmm good need in Antigua the island with 365 Beaches ,Cruise Ships customer would love it ...pjr777group.com 
124149619252_10153656854824253:Notice the LACK of a cutting clove o his left hand. Chipotle doesn't use them (I should know, I worked for a store for about a month).
124149619252_10153246130479253:Bravo Chipotle!  Do not let the pro-gmo movement sway you!  This is what your customers (and the world) want!  One step at a time...
124149619252_10153262094399253:Okay, so all you who say you worked at Chipotle, you're going to have to come up off that Barbacoa recipe lol
124149619252_244957752262179:Wichita Falls, Texas will probably never have a Chipotle which is understandable but a visit from the Chipotle truck would be fantastic and well worth it, specially around the training base :-)
124149619252_10152250518069253:TY, that's what I came to this page to verify.  I suspected it was a hoax.  I shared this status to my Timeline to let people know.
124149619252_10151089035244253:All the ones that pack my bowl with copious handfuls of lettuce. Some staff give so little lettuce I sometimes had to ask for xtra xtra lettuce. 
124149619252_10152236327209253:Mmmmm  you guys don't know what you've been missing...YUM  YUM...!!!  in a bowl or burrito...can't go wrong..!!!
124149619252_10151809543439253:1) Three Words: CHOPPED SHRIMP BURRITOS. 2) What, if anything, are you going to do with Farm Team? Nothing so far...
124149619252_454413931302356:Thank you, Chipotle! All people deserve equality and respect. I will be visiting your establishments more often from here on out.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito bowl, white rice, pinto beans, tomato salsa, little sour cream, cheese and lettuce.  YUM!
124149619252_10153118469724253:I had carnitas burrito it was good and guacamole and chips it been a longtime and hated it at once good stuff
124149619252_10153150981964253:I'm pretty sure you'll need to get the Lufkin, Tx  store open before June if you're going to post things like this.......
124149619252_10152250518069253:While it isn't Chipotle Mexican Grill's fault, I believe that "Joe" could have been a bit more sympathetic with his response. Yes, I figured it wasn't  a "real" coupon, however, it could have been addressed with a kinder response.
124149619252_10151258924194253:Awesome chipotle! I already love you guys but now I respect you guys even more! So happy there is a company that supports the family time! Big hi five guys! :)
124149619252_147322035888:I'm now prouder to be an alumnus of the University of North Texas, since I'm assuming the music school there had something to do with this. :-)
124149619252_10153200118729253:Jillian Stokes I'm missing you and chipotle!! ALASKA doesn't have chipotle!! I am bawling!!! ????????????
124149619252_10152406485254253:Thanks.you guys,   I'm heading on over there for lunch more often.   Don't let the butt hurt thugs intimidate you.
124149619252_10152250518069253:If Chipotle Mexican Grill were an honorable company they would turn the hoax into a real free item giveaway.
124149619252_10152925087634253:Very proud of the decision on the pork vendor, am thrilled to continue to support his fine establishment!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Hands down Dedham, Ma.  I have been to about 15 different Chipotles, and Dedham is by far the best.  Great people, awesome food quality.
124149619252_10152935096524253:Anyway you can tell your restaurants in Secaucus NJ to stop rationing the meat? They act like I'm taking food off there plate...
124149619252_10152805746454253:Bart Verdonk Het wordt tijd dat ze eens naar Nederland komen. In Frankfurt en Parijs zitten ze al wel.
124149619252_10151251776579253:By "Like" I meant that I would drive halfway across Europe, take the ferry to Dover, then drive two hours to London just to eat you!
124149619252_10151520750889253:You should take of your human hair problem at Ohio Pike on Cincinnati, Ohio! Disgusting! Make your employees wear hair nets and maybe their hair won't end up in customers food!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Have eaten Chipotle all over the country and none even come close to any location in Colorado.  Fav still has to be the original across from DU and the Cherry Creek location.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Ckn bowl * black beans, white rice, pico de gallo, fajit a peppers & onions, the green sauce, and sour cream on the side and chz on the side. 
124149619252_10151611917404253:My first Chipotle burrito was at the Evans location back in 1995. I only knew of two stores back then...the one on Evans and one on Colorado Boulevard (at or near 13th). Now they're everwhere, including one in my small town of Pueblo, Colorado. I love it!
124149619252_135356053201187:Omg I love chipotle I had some  just yesterday! It's amazing! And all the people that work there are amazing and the best part is it's  right by my house!!!!!!! :)
124149619252_10152935096524253:How can i get my health insurance? I'm still trying to find it. It's so hard do you guys have a link I could have?
124149619252_156053474470:Delivery would be cool.  Also a drive thru pickup window for online and iphone orders only would be AWESOME too.  ;)
124149619252_10153423452749253:Hell yeah Brett 'Wolter' Nelson! But I'll be in lacrosse :(. My weekend schedule makes me miss everything!!!!!
124149619252_10151809543439253:Gorditas with barbacoa? Why the heck not. My mouth is salivating as it is. But glad to see your going to expand sofritas to rest of the U.S.also good stuff!
124149619252_10152805746454253:Chicken, brown rice, black beans, onions, peppers, corn salsa, tomato salsa, guacamole, cheese, sour cream, lettuce. A blackberry Izzy with a side of corn salsa, tomato salsa, guacamole, and chips!!???? ????????
124149619252_10153246130479253:Nice!! Now start serving locally made sodas made with cane sugar n get those corn syrups out of your beverage line! Go Chipotle go!
124149619252_10153310575624253:Umm this sounds like a must do/visit...! Shannon Bell, Jessica Lane, Brittney Benjamin, Oneita Offield, Jessica Moore
124149619252_135356053201187:Mr. Ells, LOVE your restaurant.  It's seriously an obsession of mine. But alas, we have NO Chipotle here in Savannah where we're stationed.  PLEASE SIR!  Send us some Chipotle in Savannah!  And please keep doing great and wonderful things with your restaurant!
124149619252_10153150981964253:I can roll a burrito better than that! Lol. Love Chipotle! Worked there for 2 yrs and still can't stop eating there. #Addicted <3
124149619252_10151258924194253:Good for you Chipotle!  See you on Friday, and thanks for your delicious food all year long (and the wind turbine here in Gurnee).
124149619252_10153001213604253:Thanks for pulling pulled pork from the menu! You've just gained a new customer! I have not had chipotle before but will be going to the yonge an dundas location for lunch today with some of my classmates from Ryerson University! I will be sure to spread the word that your business is interested in the ethical treatment of animals! :)
124149619252_10152990683604253:Hello Chipotle.  So we eat Chipotle on Kirkman Rd in Orlando ALL the time.  My coworker, Sabrina, has gotten the short-end of the stick a few times here recently, like today.  Please can you message me so we can discuss this?
124149619252_10151058843154253:And I'm the assistant manger there people :) we are very proud of our restaurant and what it stands for.  Glad to know many of you know about it.  Feel free to stop by any time for a burrito
124149619252_10153066985824253:Alright if Fargo got one, Sioux Falls, SD surely has to be next on the list.  Give me some hope, Joe!
124149619252_10153009001449253:What a joke at the 316 N Michigan location in Chicago. Tons of people in here waiting over 45 mins and they ran out of Sofritas! Laughable execution.
124149619252_185864848093833:LMAO you city people crack me up keep kicking the american farmer with out him yall would be pretty damn hungry. That said have yall ever seen the stuff thats bought and hauled to the slaughter yards to be made into the meat yall buy at the grocery store..if you knew it the antibiotics wouldnt sound so bad. As for chipolte my ass the meat yall serve is organic...This farmer raises her own food .
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken bowl white rice mild and hot salsa lettuce cheese sour cream with a side of guac and chips....mmmmmmm
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito Bowl, Brown Rice, Black Beans, Chicken, Medium Salsa, Sour Cream, Cheese, Lettuce, Guac (with lime). Amazing.
124149619252_10152406485254253:$8 bucks for this? This was the last straw for me and your Springfield, Il location is terrible. Rude employees, a joke for a manager and consistently poor service and even worse presentation. Not impressed at all.
124149619252_10152250518069253:it doesn't even look that real, it just says "a free meal" and "100% free food", it doesn't even specify what you're supposed to get LOL.. plus the "only one per person valid until march 20th" (without a year) is totally wrong, no capital M for March, yet the V for Valid in the middle of the sentence is capital.. the print isn't justified, syntax is wrong.. lol.. terrible attempt at making it look real
124149619252_10152786808474253:Burrito bowl, steak, white rice, black beans, two scoops of mild, one of hot and some lettuce!.... The best meal you'll ever have!!!
124149619252_185864848093833:Thats why I eat Chipolte, because they are very good about what meat they buy. If I buy eggs or meat I ALWAYS buy organic, no hormones and veggie fed. We don't know what those will do to our kids or their kids.. Its just not worth it when you have natural options.
124149619252_10151587164929253:If you would be cultivating organic corn and rice, that would be best.  Those two items (and more) on your menu are GMO, and growing organic cotton shirts are not what we eat when we come to your restaurant.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Read the article. By the end of it, it contradicts how people are interpreting headline. Not news. Dumb.
124149619252_10153736393409253:The fact that you opened your doors again after multiple people got sick without taking precautions  to insure it doesn't happen again, makes it clear your care more about profits than people...
124149619252_10153262094399253:I got a picture of what they are telling their management to tell teachers. Apparently they want to give the best experience to their patrons and combining it with teacher appreciation day isn't it.
124149619252_10151024826814253:I see people ordering different things all the time. For me it's the same thing every time. Barbacoa Fajita Burrito, with white rice, cheese, lettuce, sour cream and hot sauce. Always satisfies!!
124149619252_10151258924194253:Hooray, for CMG!!! Showing its thanks by respecting their employees family time and not for giving into the almighty dollar.
124149619252_140229971715:Awesome.. I eat Chipotle almost 3 times a week....  Does my wife being being pregnant allow here to get a free kids meal??
124149619252_10153246130479253:I don't understand science or whatever but natural news says GMOs are bad and I seen people there saying it's bad so that means it's bad.
124149619252_10151024826814253:BOWL: Brown rice, steak, tomato salsa, green salsa, corn salsa, sour cream, cheese, and extra extra guac. Then I order chips. Yum!
124149619252_10152406485254253:Never liked your food anyway you probably had Moochelle prepare it for you and your common core friends. Cultivate that thought
124149619252_228303190552746:Dude you are an idiot.  You have a great company here doing more environmentally correct things than most of the places.  You want to make a difference?  Bitch to the ones that don't give a shit.  Keep up the great work in and out of the kitchen Chipotle.
124149619252_10151089035244253:My favorite, and not just it's closest to me, is at Kellogg and Rock Road here in Wichita.  It's the location where an employee cleaned my regular table for me as I was getting my ice tea!
124149619252_10152406485254253:Welcome to chipotle sheeple...think the bad guys are going to follow the rules?...sitting duck burrito...new menu item?
124149619252_10152250518069253:@ Cait.. It is a part of good customer service.. That's all. I'm not on here to argue, just voiced my opinion or is that not allowed????
124149619252_10153022292109253:20 years ago went to the first one on East Evans in Denver. It was in the residential neighborhood so sometimes walked a block after finding a place to park. The tiny building was on corner with the line going out the door down the sidewalk. Best food ever, can't wait til the one opens in Missoula Montana. It will be 100 miles but will be worth the drive!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak Buritto: Pinto Beans, white rice, roasted chili and corn, and cheese. Then lots of Chipotle sauce as I'm eating it!
124149619252_10151089035244253:My favorite Chipotle Grill is on Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs, CO. The Manager there, Dan Friese, is amazing!
124149619252_10151024826814253:CHICKEN FAJITA BURRITO, WHITE RICE, LIGHT SOUR CREAM, CHEESE, LETTUCE, GUAC ON THE SIDE AND A LEMONADE.  I GET THIS EVERYDAY!!
124149619252_10152104828699253:Seriously LOVE that you're now in Eau Claire, WI!  I was beginning to think that my town would never have a restaurant that actually cared about the food they were serving people. Thanks for showing people that taking care of their bodies and environment DOESN'T have to be boring, expensive, or tasteless!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl, white rice, black beans, tomato & corn salsas, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and a side of salad dressing
124149619252_10152599784994253:Andrea, I'm so sorry we gave you such a poor first impression. Would you be willing to tell us more about your visit here: http://chip.tl/re0OLp? We'd like to address this right away. -Skyllo
124149619252_10152250518069253:I tried Chipotle once and wasn't so fond of it, saw the post of a free Chipotle and "was" going to give it another chance
124149619252_10153253574299253:I like your food but the store near us in Florrissant Mo is too painfully slow to ever get me in the door.  It's a bummer.
124149619252_145246312263952:There has to be a Chipotle near me to check in and earn the badge..... When oh when will you build in Montgomery, AL????
124149619252_10151024826814253:carnitas-barbacoa burrito with black beans, mild salsa, corn salsa, lettuce, sour cream, cheese, and guac. QUE DELICIA!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Don't matter if it's a hoax that's false advertising because even if it's some hoax your still getting free advertisement from it being passed around
124149619252_10151089035244253:It WOULD be Woodstock, Ga......IF we had one, but, I like the Marietta, Ga. Location. The guys there do a great job!
124149619252_10153514914799253:It has been 12 years since I started eating chipotle foods, and I have nothing to complain I always enjoy it.
124149619252_10153246130479253:I think I will eat my burrito elsewhere. I would prefer a company who didn't market to science illiterates.
124149619252_10152307671269253:Nein, du Nuss! Ich bekomme einen Burrito von dir. Das weiß jeder...Das steht seit geraumer Zeit fest. Der Flug ist noch nicht gebucht, Fräulein...Du solltest das nicht an meinem köstlichen Burrito scheitern lassen! Amelie Mur
124149619252_10153246130479253:all of you talking about the hundreds of studies done saying GMOs are completely okay to eat. keep in mind researchers being paid by big corporations who obviously have conflicts of interest...
124149619252_10151809543439253:Pickled onions sound awesome. For now, could you please offer grilled onions separate from the grilled bell peppers?? Please?? Thanks!
124149619252_156053474470:Rarely does humanity come up with a creation that combines form, function, art and science in such a way as this. First, the moon landing. Then, the mapping of the human genome. Now this. We are a species on the brink of greatness.
124149619252_182078509223:bring it to middleburg hts, ohio! i have been waiting for chipotle to release a breakfast for the longest time
124149619252_10153246130479253:Too bad all the people praising chipotle here have no understanding of what a GMO is or that they benefit proeple and the environment and are just as safe as conventional crops. Great marketing ploy though.
124149619252_156053474470:Wow! Great feedback. If you'd like a response from me to a particular question or what not, throw it up on the wall and I'll get back to each and every one. Just give me a few minutes/hours.  Keep 'em comin'! - Colin
124149619252_363324750372027:Peter -- check your "other" messages (yes there really is such a thing!  messages from fan pages and non-friends go there).  You won't get a notification.  ...which reminds me, I haven't checked mine in a while.... brb!
124149619252_10152250518069253:I can understand chipotle being upset by this hoax.  Unfortunately I think they are missing the boat in regards to customer appreciation and marketing gained by this posting.   Many companies are benefiting from giveaways via Facebook posts.  Chipotle has offered free burritos before.  Sad they couldn't honor it for the customers who are supporting their franchise.
124149619252_10153489055424253:Alex Garcia!! Could this be more accurate!? (The pregnancy ones ????????) I think I'm getting some tomorrow lol
124149619252_10153009001449253:Melissa Smith - don't they know it's supposed to snow tonight into tomorrow!?! They planned this so they won't have to give away nothing free!! ????????
124149619252_10152516479684253:If you don't want to buy from the U.S. then locate your business outside the U.S. I used to eat at this restaurant,  until I learned about them. I will never eat there again and let everbody I know what's really going on. Good bye Chipotle.
124149619252_205455487672:So the husband (who won't get a FB account) wants to know why y'all haven't made a breakfast burrito yet? So...why haven't ya?
124149619252_10153693560944253:I don't live in the northwest, so I don't have a dog in this fight, but will you honor the $3 boo-rito promotion for the affected stores? After all, Chipotle voluntarily closed these locations knowing it had made a promise to its customers that on Halloween they would get $3 burritos. It would a contractual faux pas to not honor this.
124149619252_10152949800154253:Hang in there chipotle, the ones who say the loudest that they "won't be back" probably never have been nor planned  on coming. Think  chick fil a.
124149619252_105860719543628:I am sooo stoked about the commercial...loved it before I knew it was Chipotle! Your food rocks; what youre trying to do with sustainable farming is outstanding; I so appreciate the food you make; and Willie Nelson was the best choice to do the song  :)
124149619252_10152883478794253:Looks like Mike Bennett doesn't know the difference between credible witness and discredited witness! I hope one day someone lies about a situation you're involved in and NOBODY believes a word you say because "the liar" has spoken! SMH!
124149619252_10153489055424253:You guys are skimmping on food since the non gmo, Im getting way less food and had yo ask for it. Sad face :(
124149619252_454413931302356:Phoebe: "Why not allow the Boy Scouts to set their own policies according to their consciences, and not harass those of us..."  Ummm... you realize you're doing exactly what you're complaining about, right?  Why not let Chipotle set their own policies and not harass those of us who support gay rights?
124149619252_10152022699034253:Andrew Nuebel La Bodega Negra & Wahaca are actually not that bad ;) and there a few of Wahacas as well..
124149619252_10150260442884253:I love this concept. Teaching young people about the importance of while foods and the farm to table concept is admirable. I have always wanted to learn how to incorporate this in practice.
124149619252_10153232136249253:Chipotle rocks thank you for helping consumers have a healthy eat out choice! Now stay open 24 hours a day.  Its a freaking hot table line easy to do!
124149619252_10153806089609253:I have worked at the coon Rapids location for a little over 2 years now. Just about ready to graduate from college and even after my school I can say that I will still go to chipotle afterwards. I enjoy working with all of the people there and they have made my life a different thing since high school. I really hope people will still go to chipotle and enjoy the special culture we have there!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl - light brown rice, double black beans, double pinto beans, chicken, double hot salsa, and cheese!
124149619252_10152724330769253:When we get one in Houma, Louisiana I will be sure to do that. Otherwise, driving 45 miles just to get a burrito is not what I would do on a regular basis.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa Fajita Burrito with Corn and Hot Salsa, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and DON'T FORGET THE GUAC! :D EVERY TIME
124149619252_156053474470:I would never have to leave my house, well except to go to work to earn more money to order more home delivered Chipolte!
124149619252_131676086962937:"You have to "like" Chipotle on Foursquare's website first."  seriously, put this in the directions if this is true.  I have a TON of checkins and no badge
124149619252_10152773616059253:Science has shown that GMOs are safe to eat. Chipotle obviously has good intentions, as do all anti-GMO activists, but they just don't know what they're talking about.
124149619252_10153867363919253:I love chipotle and always get a steak bowl but lately half the steak is inedible and very grisly and fatty, therefore I have not been able to enjoy it very much :(
124149619252_10153246130479253:Crunchy Christian Mommy wow. You actually waste your time writing a blog mocking other blogs... Nice. #getalife
124149619252_10152748433069253:Chipotle may have raised their prices, but when you consider the quality of food you are getting, it is a great deal and not to mention the proceeds go to an amazing organization.
124149619252_10152996855759253:Thank you for your commitment to higher standards for the way meat animals should be raised.  I have gained a lot if respect for your company!
124149619252_10153830182809253:So sorry you had to go through this whole food poisoning thing. You will always be my favorite fast food because you care to serve fresh healthy food without GMO's.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Chipotle Mexican Grill since the governor of NJ ordered a state of emergency due to the snow blizzard, can we (New Jersey) purchase the sofritas on Wednesday 1-2815?????
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thank you for listening to Food Babe and Thank you for giving us good quality food! I love Chipotle and my husband and I eat a couple times a week because we know we are getting good food and no GMOs !!! Wish there were more restaurants like you!!

124149619252_10151258924194253:Last Thanksgiving, I worked for Best Buy. I had to be at work at midnight, the night of Thursday going into Friday. I didn't get to spend much time with my family because of this, having to sleep all afternoon and evening to prepare. This year, I work for Chipotle. I'm spending the day with my parents and, although I have to work Friday, it's my standard, normal shift of 8am-3:30pm. Thanks for being closed!
124149619252_100780796665922:nothing like qdoba to make you appreciate chipotle, i mean i like their queso but nothing else....honestly i'd rather eat taco bell than qboba
124149619252_10152278716624253:I love the new chipotle in Kingston,  ny...thx for coming our way.   Now Kingston just needs a trader Joe's.
124149619252_10153310575624253:Somerset Ridge Vineyard and Winery is very psyched to have our wines chosen for this epic event!  It's going to be a party of deliciousness!
124149619252_10151839071994253:Das ist sehr gut!  Too bad I don't live in Germany anymore.  Do you have any other locations in Germany?
124149619252_196891642078:Amazing, Responsible, delicious, refreshinglyNewAndTasty (Can that be one word).  In a word (or two or so).... The way it should be.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I get the feeling the only reason they are pushing this "deal" is because nobody actually had any interest in trying this stuff in the first place haha
124149619252_10150256700954253:I'm kind of creeped out now because there's a local inferior burrito chain celebrating its 16th birthday today. if you go to a certain location at a certain time today to meet the founder, you get a free burrito, or you get one for four bucks if you check in on foursquare so I think that's a proper celebration...hint hint
124149619252_10153163816204253:Just moved to KY from MN where there are chipoltes everywhere the closes chipolte is in Nashville TN, might want to consider putting a chipolte in bowling green, KY not only would it make myself and my family estatic, but this is the city with the 300 restaurants, and hotels also corvette capital of the world so lots of tourism...
124149619252_10153009001449253:I'm disappointed that you guys ran out of sofritas before 6:30pm when I checked at 3 different chipotle here in San Francisco... I hope the next promotion will be better prepared...
124149619252_10153001213604253:The one benefit of the pork is that it is not spicy. For those of us who ate it because our digestive system can't handle spicy, maybe you could offer a less spicy version of the chicken when pork isn't available?
124149619252_10152250518069253:Ya to think Chipotle would do something nice like that is a lil far fetch. It's all about the $ with them.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl with tortilla on the side....plain rice, black beans, 1/2 chicken, 1/2 barbacoa, sour cream LOTS of cheese and hot salsa!!! YUMMY!!! and dont forget the chips and salsa! :)
124149619252_10153009001449253:And ppl say vegan food cannot be good. It is delicious :) I literally cannot wait till the 26th. Having one tomorrow :)
124149619252_10151192106409253:I love Chipotle!!They put one in by my house and if I could I would eat there every day.Do you guys do free burritos on your birthdays?Some do some don't why is that?
124149619252_10153009001449253:I got it suckassssss. But I'll stick with the chicken. Chipotle just isn't chipotle without the chicken.
124149619252_156053474470:The ONLY good thing in Ohio. It's always only in Cali or only in NY. It's worth living here, thanks to delivermyburrito.
124149619252_10152586158139253:I got ripped off! $45 in food and barely any of it edible... just fat and gristle... I love Chipotle but I'm never eating there again unless this wrong is righted. Very upset to get home (30 minutes away) to eat and find out none of the food you bought is worth eating.. the chips were even hard as rocks... SO ANGRY!!!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:I'm in Sunnyvale, CA and when I finally got to the front of a very long line, they announced they were out and we were out of luck! I went through that for nothing! I checked the website. There is no comment on availability. It's not my fault they ran out. Probably never going to eat at Chipotle again! I live near too many authentic Mexican restaurants to put up with this.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Joe Libraro was it me or was today the day it was supposed to be free. Did I read it wrong. I'm confused!
124149619252_10153351140389253:Lexi Rivera if u n lakesha(not sure how to spell it) get here soon lets go out for dinner just us girls b4 y'all head back!
124149619252_10152250518069253:No, chipotle offered FREE food if you wore FOIL anywhere on ur body! (A few years ago during haloween I believe) get your theories straight Joe
124149619252_180887498696:i for sure saw this movie. it wasnt playing in very many movie theatre. only in 1 theatre that i could find actually but it was really good and really insightful. i'll be buying it :)

124149619252_10153576894879253:I just pictured what's gonna happen when a Burrito gets kicked and I'm laughing over here. *SPLAT*  "Good grief!"
124149619252_10152637637569253:Your ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen would probably do well in South Chesterfield, VA 23803.  Think about coming here!  You have a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Colonial Heights, VA 23834 and South Chesterfield is less than 5 miles from that location. South Chesterfield is growing and your new restaurant could grow with us! Check into it, Please!!!
124149619252_279121798773401:Oh, how I miss Chipotle.  I moved back to Corpus Christi, TX after living in Arizona for 12 years.  <sigh>  I even drove 2 hours to a nearby town just to eat at Chipotle. Yes, I have a problem.  A deliciously awesome problem.  CC has zero choices for yummy "fast casual."  We need Chipotle!
124149619252_10152406485254253:You will learn this was a bad move. I am betting you will lose business. Should have stayed clear of the debate entirely. 
124149619252_10151089035244253:It uses to be Woodland Hills, CA. Why...they had Gardein...but alas no more. Sigh...now just any ole place'll do. Chipotle or not. Sorry 
124149619252_228034027252006:No chipotle here in San Angelo, TX. :( But soon we'll be leaving this pit and going to Maryland where there are quite a few nearby. :)

124149619252_10153132892604253:It's needs key lime juice and lots of it! Guac is not guac without lime! Love Chipotle but I love the way I make my guac
124149619252_10153395310879253:Hahaha you guys are going to stop eating at chipotle because they support gay marriage?? Hahaha that's awesome. Good for you chipotle. One more reason why Matt Williams and I love putting your meat in our mouths.
124149619252_10152093036984253:But why not just close for the entire day on the 24th so families can be together all day? I love Chipotle, so this is just a curious question.
124149619252_10153514914799253:I was a racist once. Many years ago. I use to despise all minorities. It all changed one day when I got stranded on the side of the road on a cross-state trip.   I watched car after car pass me. I was cold, hungry, upset, tired. Finally one car stopped and offered help. Very nice man. He gave me a ride into town. I mentioned that I was hungry and when we reached town, he pulled into a TACO truck and before I could say anything, he said it was his father's food truck! I couldn't even tell he was Mexican!! I felt so weird inside. Angry. But, I was starving! So, as much as was pissed off, I decided to just eat the free meal he offered.   IT WAS THE MOST AMAZING FOOD I EVER HAD!!! I fell in love with Tacos instantly!!!! It changed my life!!! In the moment, I knew I could not hate anymore. I love and respect everyone now.   Who knew a taco could change a man's heart?

124149619252_185864848093833:Um, Chipotle is owned by McDonalds and I am pretty sure McDonalds and chipotle both use cheap meat that has plenty of junk in it!
124149619252_10151486609219253:White rice, a little of the black beans, chicken, mild salsa, corn salsa, sour cream, cheese and lettuce!  YUM!

Even though the line was all the way to the door we only waited about 5 minutes and we were out the door which is about a third of the time we would normally spend in that situation. Thank you so much. Chipotle Mexican Grill 4130 Tuscararawas St, Canton OH

124149619252_10151024826814253:Vegan! black beans, fajitas, brown rice, hot, mild and corn salsa and lettuce. I stray away from the delicious guac because there is always cheese contamination :(
124149619252_156053474470:Ooooh! That's cool! It'd be even more awesome if they had a drive-thru...lol...it'd be easier to get amazing food when you have 6 kids in the van ages 7 and under! (-but it's totally worth it to get everyone unbuckled, go in and order and then get everyone back in their car-seats!) ;)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Wrap. Chicken. Black beans. Hot salsa. Sour cream. Guacamole. Cheese. Lettuce. BAM! And done :) no rice though...none of that!

124149619252_10153246130479253:I vote with dollars and you will get no dollars from me.  This was a marketing move, not a health move.
124149619252_10153547799644253:So when is Chipotle going to have Guacamole again? They  have been out of Guac here for 2 months, and it's just not the same. I have actually not gone there a couple times because it's just not as good without guac.
124149619252_10151486609219253:White rice, no beans, Steak, extra steak, corn, extra corn, lots of hot salsa and cheese. All mixed up. Heavenly!
124149619252_256556984380282:I really think Chipotle did a fantastic job with this event. It was a gorgeous, crisp, fall day. Thanks for the free burrito after getting my pamphlet stamped after visiting various stations.

124149619252_10152773616059253:Thank you for taking a stand and keeping your values! This is why me and my friends give Chipotle Mexican Grill our money for lunch when we go out.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Just picked up our standard order for the family. Kid's quesadilla, chicken rice bowl with guacamole, large quesadilla with all the meat options and a double wrapped carnitas and barbacoa burrito.
124149619252_454413931302356:At least Freebird's is not owned by McDonald's, that vile purveyor of fried crapola! Nothing on your parent company's menu agrees with my tummy. I'd rather go to Whataburger for even better fries!

124149619252_10153246130479253:Now you can say you serve healthy food. Wait, there's no nutritional difference? Prices will go up?  At least people will believe something is better, I guess that placebo effect will compensate for paying more for those who believe it.

124149619252_10152632602189253:Raymond  Dorisita  Fabian Yadhira Michael Peter  Andii Pollo Loco Genesis  Araceli Frank  Jocelyn  these are hilarious!!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Jacqueline Warner I keep seeing this everywhere so it must be a sign that we need to make a sacrifice
124149619252_10151086390274253:chipotle is not real mexican food! its like calling pizza hut italian food. if you want real mexican food, go to a taco shop in san diego.
124149619252_10153602183249253:Ok so because i got a bit bored I looked at the ad that is circulating and then the one on reddit and noticed that it was taken at a football game where the teams color was purple...I googled the school color (because if you look and think about it was a high school football game) and it pops up as the Southern California area.... That is also where the reddit poster seems to be from... Coincidence maybe???
124149619252_10152883474639253:E Pluribus Beanum... "Out of many, bean."  ...seriously? Whomever designed that really wasn't thinking.
124149619252_10150637170574253:I love an opportunity to stay PLANT STRONG!!  Healthy food is so important!  Brown rice, fajita veggies and a little tofu chorizo.  Yumminess!  I hope this goes national!
124149619252_205082546217004:As Amber points out, this ranking is based upon perception, not reality.  I love Chipotle, but I'm not under any illusion that it's healthy.  Go look up how many calories are in a burrito -- you'll be quite shocked by what you find.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Be sure and ASK for the receipt. The guy at the Palm Desert Chipotle is not giving them out automatically. Happened to 3 of us who ordered the sofritas. Sneaky if you ask me.
124149619252_10152949800154253:"We have also taken appropriate actions with regard to the employee involved" What exactly does this mean? And why did you hire someone who thinks this clear disrespect of a customer is appropriate behavior at their place of employment? Obviously, more time for customer service training needs to be spent with your new hires. I am reconsidering my further support of your establishments.
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito bowl w/ white rice, pinto, half steak half chicken, all the salsas with only a little bit of spicy, corn, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito fajita bowl: chicken, mild salsa, cheese and lettuce. Small chips with salsa or guac...yummy! Its gonna be a Chipotle Day 2morrow for lunch!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Basically saying, "Sorry we made you order this. Here's something that won't go directly into the trash."
124149619252_140229971715:what's in a kids meal? Cuz my little one says its to hot (spicy) so I dont think its kid friendly! ??
124149619252_10151024826814253:Fajita Burrito:  Chicken and Pork (double meat), with rice, lettuce, onions & peppers, corn salsa, and sour cream.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Tell ur employee's to stop skimping on the steak! But when they do bless us with more meat than other stuff it's heaven! Fajita burrito with rice, steak, sour cream, cheese, mild salsa sometimes with guac! Priceless!
124149619252_10152453918534253:Don't ask for any meat & you won't get any meat, the veggie style burrito's are absolutely wonderful====> extra sauce & add chips to snack on while checking out the game or your favorite television show.
124149619252_205455487672:That would be the best news I heard all month! U can show them what a lovely burrito tastes like!! I can't wait!! 
124149619252_10151258924194253:Really wish you had a location in Smokey Point/Marysville Washington!!  I miss your food!!!! The closest one to me is 20 miles away!
124149619252_10153246130479253:GMO's are not less toxic, do not require les area to grow crops and do not keep costs down. The farm act, my tax dollars, pays subsidizes to GMO farmers and if it did not they would cost more than organics because of the cost the biotech industry puts on seed.  You people have no clue what is really going on.
124149619252_156053474470:I think it's the best decision ever!!!!  we do fax orders alot at my work and sometimes it's hard for one of us to leave to pick it up.  Trust me i thought of this idea a LONG time ago!!!!   Oh i have another great idea, i'm a very frequent customer and i think u guys should have those cards that after some many times u get one free!  ya know!!!   Think about it.....!!   :-)
124149619252_10153246130479253:Now if they were concerned about how they treat employees that would be another step in the right direction
124149619252_100780796665922:I prefer Chipotle and have always found Qdoba to be bland, but I do like that they have nachos. I also ate their salads before Chipotle started offering salads. And I will be enticed into Qdoba for one of their coupons or incentives. I wish Chipotle did more of that. We eat there at least 3 times a month.
124149619252_10153844182544253:ALL fast food restaurants are serving up nasty, GMO, anti-biotic, hormone injected chicken & beef! Chipotle has made a huge stand, to offer non-GMO products! ????
124149619252_10151086390274253:We have our final week of beach vball this weekend. If we want to win gold, CLEARLY we need to eat at Chipotle. Right Joshua G Anderegg?
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito 1/2 rice, black beans, steak, tomato salsa, corn salsa, cheese, sour cream, a little guacamole and a little lettuce. boom best burrito ever especially if you get someone who can actually roll it together n doesn't tear!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:This would have been great, but both of the stores in my are were out of sofritas.  Seems like too much time was spent promoting this deal, while not enough time was spent doing sales predictions.
124149619252_130916887010628:Whats the fine print? Is it 1 burrito per person or can 1 person order 4. Hubby is going as a farmer but the rest of us will be nintendo guys. No booritos for us?
124149619252_10153163816204253:Especially for Doc Braun Bear & his lovely wife Isabella Ra-so-le-knee! Happy date nite. ????EXTRA NAPKINS, PLEASE! ????????
124149619252_10153555173409253:Thats because they broke the first rule of chipotle ... You never completely remove the burrito from the foil
124149619252_454413931302356:Ben Ibach Actually I said they mentioned that all would be just fine. But yes, they were polite too, as were we. - Joe
124149619252_10152927494854253:I used to eat at the one in Castle Rock once a week with my family, but you won't see me this week or any other.
124149619252_10151486609219253:White rice pinto beans steak and chicken double meat tomatoes corn drown in sour cream cheese guacamole and lettuce = orgasm in my mouth
124149619252_10151024826814253:double wrapped brown rice both beans and fajitas with barbacoa beef and mild salsa corn salsa and hot salsa sour cream cheese and lettuce. Thank you Chipoltle for the amazing gift of heaven in my mouth!!!!!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Wow Joe. Couldn't have been a little nice in this post? If loosing customers is your goal than you are winning! A+++ Jerk! <3
124149619252_175763983493:How about a new Chipotle in Powdersville, SC to go with our new Kohl's, and Target store? Please?????
124149619252_10151089035244253:I love the location in Orland Park, IL! It was the first Chipotle I've gone to and the one I prefer! Great food, grey workers! 
124149619252_520689341285681:Great that you are serving a variety to make your customers happy.  But I will be sticking with my steak or chicken, thanks!
124149619252_122372141178171:Valerie - Have you missed the entire concept of his show?  He has no interest in putting companies that serve REAL food out of business.  The point is actually quite the opposite.  He WANTS real food to be served.  I have yet to find anything processed at Chipotle.  He supports them completely.
124149619252_10153489422339253:I played the game as well and I never received my bogo free offer. This is very disappointing. Chipotle Mexican Grill
124149619252_10153489055424253:Im a chipotle employee and We have a few refulars who are there more than us lol. Usually its a small group of marines who go in and order a ton, like they each get a quesorito and a bowl, then they come back for the same thing again lol.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Lisa-Denise Mason I'm pretty sure the joking "interwebs" as well as the rest of the content of said post was in regards to nearly every single "repost, tag, and follow for free" offer circulating Facebook is a hoax unless coming from the legitimate Facebook page of said company. Not to mention, your post about IHOPs free pancakes was for their annual "free pancake day" which goes on every year with a charity donations to a cause being strongly encouraged for the event. Which, by the way, was announced and endorsed by the company itself. Companies have hoaxes running around the internet all of the time and I imagine you'd want to have fun with it when responding to yet another one, otherwise you'd probably go insane
124149619252_10151024826814253:Noooooooooo. You are torturing me. Worked all day and class now. Will be out by ten when the nearest chipotle will be closed ! =(
124149619252_329592670434256:I don't do four square but I do soooo love everything on the menu and eat there two to three times wkly
124149619252_10152453918534253:I just tried Pizzeria Locale yesterday in Denver, and tomorrow I'm gonna try Shophouse while I'm working at Cultivate in San Francisco!  Also.. I knew all of that. Lol
124149619252_10152560126959253:I don't think my order is listed: Bowl Brown rice No beans Steak Corn Hot salsa Sour cream  Cheese Lettuce Yummm!
124149619252_10152571682409253:Did you know that about 1/3 of their food is manufactured (key word their) by the same company that manufactures McDonald's "food"?
124149619252_167132760066216:Some food fills but does not satisfy.  Chipotle has a burrito that will do both  Make it yours by having it personalized...
124149619252_130482563683418:What burrito war? Haven't found burritos likes yours any places else.   Oh I would love brown rice too.
124149619252_10152406485254253:They will get a LOT more business now!!! We already have a group of over 100 going to the one in my town.
124149619252_10151520750889253:Noooooooooooooooooo you disappoint meeeeeeee now in gonna have to fill eggs with something other than burritos
124149619252_10153009001449253:Tofu? Pretty sure carnivores don't eat tofu.. I like how you try to pass off tofu like it has flavor, lol.
124149619252_10152724330769253:Thomas Sawyer Axel El Capitan Yann Peverini c'est exactement le chipotle dans lequel on est allé sur la 5e avenue !!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa Bowl with white rice, black beans, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, corn salsa, and hot salsa.  I have been living in Mexico for two years now, and will be returning to the states in late October.  Chipotle is a DAY ONE meal for me upon return!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Words cannot describe how happy I am for the upcoming free one.  Steak, here I come next month! (Because I only allow myself one per month otherwise I'd be as big as a house.)
124149619252_10152990683604253:I love Chipotle, we eat there once or twice a week.  A few times in Colorado, I would eat there for lunch and dinner....Love Chipotle...
124149619252_10153253574299253:All non GMO as you've turned a new leaf I assume. Corn tacos are most definitely GMO. I'd love to get me som GMO food. Do you deliver?
124149619252_10153009001449253:Tried the sofritas the other day. It was SO good! Not a vegetarian, I was just curious. So glad i did. I will be taking you up in this one Chipolte! Thank you :)
124149619252_10151719407409253:That was crazy!!  I had to refresh and re-enter everything to get the "Submit" button to work.............  That took an extra 10...
124149619252_153487264707094:Dream of you, Wake and think of you.                                           Hrs pass before we're together,           Finally you and me alone,steak burrito heaven...aaww
124149619252_10151719407409253:If you're having trouble submitting, go back over your puzzle and make sure you didn't accidentally leave any spots blank. That fixed the problem for me.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Booooo!!!! Why would you offer a #teacherappreciation offer one year and then not the next!?! Very disappointing. Guess I have no reason to splurge on Chipotle anytime soon.
124149619252_10151626575004253:Stop robbing me of my protein Chipotle. I see how you do. Give me 3x the beans and rice but skimp out on the most important part: the protein. It's really ridiculous to pay two more dollars for double meat when really half a spoon more would be a good ratio. Sure your food is healthy, but the amount of carbs, rice and corn you give people will still contribute to obesity. IM JUS SAIYAN.
124149619252_10153150981964253:This reminds me of my boy Jason Vargas putting in work when we would get slammed at Mission Valleys Chipotle!...
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito with Lemon rice pinto beans mild and medium salsa cheese corn sour cream and of course I add  guacamole.
124149619252_10151086390274253:Well, I'll be, Joe.  I didn't know there's a Chipotle in London.  My wife says, "Of course there is.  But there's not one in Woodstock, GA. USA!"  Why is this, Joe?
124149619252_182078509223:This needs to be company wide not just at the one location. Everyone should have a chance to try this!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito bowl white rice black beans corn salsa cheese sour cream lettuce chips with more corn salsa and a Coke Zero. For here please.
124149619252_10152992584389253:Mmmmmmm......    that's two meals covered next week!   I'm already in love with Sofritas and now a spicy noodle bowl as an extra gift after my free burrito?   Is that legal?
124149619252_100780796665922:Qdoba has no signature flavor which I think is a was of time in the food industry. You need flavor so people will say "Hmm, I think I want Chipotle tonight." lol
124149619252_10153734396969253:Last Monday we purchased meals. My eldest daughter and I had the same thing, the rest of the family had something different. Her and I both ended up sick for the remainder of the week. I then found out about the E coli problem on Facebook over the weekend. None of the other family members including the toddler got sick. Only my eldest and I, we ate the Chicken. Might be a coincidence and i'll leave it at that. Just thought strange that nobody else except my daughter and I.   I hope you can sort out the Ecoli problem and see what is causing it.
124149619252_10153395310879253:Marisela Maria Tatiana Sibonéy a little inappropriate ???? but I get it was intended as a well meaning sentiment.
124149619252_179271002091714:I just got my chicken buritto fix after being SO DISAPPOINTED showing up there yesterday and it was closed for their Christmas party.
124149619252_10153215460149253:Do you know that fried fahita bell peppers are toxic in chipottle with burned to black toxic charcle stuff and grilled chicken or steak is also straight cancer for you because it is also burned
124149619252_10151486609219253:Chicken, brown rice, onions, peppers, mild salsa, guacamole, cheese, sour cream, & chips + salsa. ;D gosh, now I want one!
124149619252_10151149863494253:I LOVE Chipotle's....just looking forward to getting it in the grocery store, like Rallly's fries...lol!
124149619252_10153357673124253:I will not return to Chipotle until they fix the carnitas problem. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. I'm done with the franchise.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito w/ white rice, sour cream, cheese and lettuce. Same everytime. Sometimes with a margarita =)
124149619252_10151058843154253:I was just there Wednesday. Gurnee, IL. The wind turbine provides part of the energy it uses among other green initiatives.
124149619252_10153246130479253:If you cooked your meat with sunflower oil instead of rice bran, i could eat more. But hell, its better than soybean  oil! #whole30problems
124149619252_10153246130479253:Son lo mejor en burritos y bowl chicken me justa mucho 14 años comiendo chiplotle mexican grill es lo mejor para comida
124149619252_100780796665922:You get the edge because your chicken is spicy. But your chips are old and stale as hell, while Qdoba's are hot and fresh.
124149619252_10152996855759253:I would just like to THANK YOU for showing love and compassion for pigs. You show the world that all animals deserve to be treated humanely, even the ones we eat. People notice what you do and it means a lot. Keep doing what you're doing Chipotle!
124149619252_10153009001449253:I would love to try it but the closest Chipotle Mexican Grill is over 2 hours away. I think Bemidji Mn could easily support one!
124149619252_10153009001449253:any chance your going to reschedule this offer for people on the east coast? All Chipotles near me have been closed for the storm =\
124149619252_10153009001449253:Lol I know Blair Forrest! I figured I might as well try it. But I hope ppl start using other ways to get their protein too. In the long run tofu might not be all that great for you.
124149619252_10152560126959253:My current fave is a bowl with white rice, pinto beans, carnitas and cheese... and use the chips to scoop it up.  Whats that say?
124149619252_10153830182809253:Do they have the illness under control yet? Seems like new cases STILL happening. Even AFTER a complete clean up and overhaul. I totally believe it was sabotage. But I need them to have the all clear before I can go again and I'm dying to go again ???????? pleeease fix this! I miss you Chipotle! We had a thing for a while there and I'm lost without you ????????
124149619252_10152805746454253:I like the bowl better and it will have white rice, fajitas, barbacoa, green salsa,  corn and sour cream!
124149619252_105860719543628:YAY   not that you need an ad...I mean everytime I go to any chipotle in any state....theyre packed with humans waiting in line :)      Thats a good thing :)
124149619252_10151024826814253:A tortilla in a bowl, white rice, chicken, half a scoop of black beans, cheese, two scoops of sour cream.. mixed, and eaten with chips. To drink, a mix of Mr. Pibb and Coke <3
124149619252_10151486609219253:brown rice, black beans, pico de gallo, green sauce, little red, sour cream, guacamole, and little lettuce.
124149619252_10153395310879253:Well, that is all gay and stuff, pun intended, but question is when will I have a closer Chipotle's to drive to, instead of 20 miles!! We need one in Trinity/Odessa, FL. Lots of us there, homo and hetero.
124149619252_10153489055424253:I would be more obsessed with it if it would COME TO MY TOWN so I don't have to drive 2.5 hours away to get it. -_-
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie bowl-brown rice, fajita veggies, black beans, sour cream, guacamole, cheese, and tomatillo salsa with LOTS of lettuce:)
124149619252_10153246130479253:Awesome, thank you so much for the hard work in achieving this goal. We are now frequent visitors to your restaurant.
124149619252_10152100184844253:Juan - ask and you can try the different meats (I am a barbacoa addict).  I always go with the bowl to avoid 300+ calories of a low nutrition tortilla.
124149619252_10153896327714253:I L??VE Chipotle! I've been eating Chipotle food at various locations in NJ on a regular basis for the past 5 years! It's tasty "real" food! I've never been sick & I'll continue to be a loyal customer!
124149619252_10151086390274253:Awesome!! Good luck in your match against April Ross and Jennifer Kessy!! What a game against another US team!! I am rooting for a US win :D
124149619252_10151836503014253:Lauren McClusky, Rita Winiecki and myself had a great time in the VIP Chipotle lounge! Thank you for the free meal!
124149619252_10151961054499253:I'm sorry but this place suck the food portions was so poor the I was embarrassing will never come back to this one
124149619252_10150719072154253:I got dinner for my husband (who was working late) and myself tonight at Chipotle, and it was wonderful as always. I saw the sign about being closed on Sunday, and was really impressed that you do that for your employees.  Way to go, Chipotle!
124149619252_10152082036279253:Eric Woltkamp, I have a feeling a stop here is in our future.... Burrito for lunch.  Pizza for dinner.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I will give this a try.  I've had tofu every way possible and don't like it.  Maybe this will be the one.  I refuse to give up
124149619252_279121798773401:I hate to say it, but I occasionally have a hard time deciding between Chipotle and Five Guys. (It doesn't help that they're literally next door to each other.)
124149619252_10151719407409253:this is very frustrating... it would have been better writing the answers in the blank than this way ... wont take my answers...
124149619252_10151058843154253:There's more to leed platinum than wind power. Proximity to public transportation, bike racks, green roof, rain barrels, permeable parking lots, generating domestic hot water using solar roof panels, geothermal energy, etc. There's a lot of commitment to a leed platinum design. Awesome!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Charlotte South Blvd location is awesome but I wish they had more parking! Oh well... just waiting for the University City location to open this month! No more 45 minute trips for lunch!
124149619252_10150959152619253:They have white corn instead of yellow....and nobody speaks English haha, but it's still freaking delicious.

124149619252_10152406485254253:I'm a frequent customer but you support of Americas most easily solved public health crisis is baffling. What difference does the environment make to a dead person?
124149619252_10153236016399253:I just got on postmates.com and they wanted to charge 10 dollar delivery fee...won't be using it...this kinda sucks
124149619252_10153302468484253:Went right from the #MarchAgainstMonsanto to fuel up at #Chipotle. Voting with my wallet is the most important vote!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Aaand just when I had finally solved the Chipotle v. Qdoba battle for myself. Please take the lime out of your rice (it's weird) and I'll be yours forever, Chipotle.
124149619252_10152406485254253:You encourage the open carrying of firearms in your restaurants?  If I were in your restaurant and someone entered with a AR-15 rifle I would leave immediately and never return.  This policy must really raise your insurance, that gets paid by your customers.  If your restaurants are so dangerous that firearms are necessary for personal protection, it might be better to eat somewhere else. 
124149619252_10153009001449253:if.... IF... you hand delivered to my house a tofu burrito, rapped in solid gold foil by a chick in a micro bikini,  I still wouldn't open the door.   What the hell?? What's next?  Himalayan toasted pine nuts for desert?
124149619252_10151024826814253:a burrito, steak, pico di geo, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, white rice, green salsa, brow beans, potatos, n'  yah thts pretty mutch it!!

124149619252_267832333301923:I have to spend $18 for a free burrito!  I have too many insulated lunch bags galore.  I should get a job there.
124149619252_10151086390274253:I ate chipotle before college volleyball tryouts one year. Very bad idea...heart burn like crazy. Still sooooo gooooddd!!!! Good luck!!
124149619252_10152883478794253:So sad that your employees are so disrespectful of NYPD officers. I will no longer support Chipotle until I see that corrective action has been taken.
124149619252_10152883478794253:From what I remember you had a bunch of workers actually quit in the middle of a shift because of "slave like labor". In state college or altoona pa.   Seams to me there is an issue much larger than just your employees.   I'll eat at the dobes from here on out.
124149619252_10153246130479253:The cool thing about non GMOs is that we already know what they are. We (consumers) dont always know exactly how some GMOs have been modified and we don't always know the long term effects of some of these products. Also Monsanto is shady
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa salad, no dressing, brown rice, black beans, mixture of mild & hot, guacamole-yes-I-know-it's-extra
124149619252_10152883478794253:So is Chipotle capable of answering a question its customers ask? Does the employees responsible still work for Chipotle?
124149619252_10153009001449253:And to the tofu haters, chipotle tofu is the only tofu ive ever liked! Give it a try you just might agree!
124149619252_10151520750889253:As much as I would LOVE a burrito on Sunday, I can wait til Monday! Thanks to Chipotle for supporting a Holiday! And their employees!
124149619252_10152583738794253:I love this whole "Cultivating Thought" cup and bag series, it's awesome! Gives you awesome things to talk about while you eat awesome food!!
124149619252_10153096213679253:Would like to know how your employees are watching their hands @ Chipotle on i10 & N Fry Rd if there isn't any hot water in women's bathroom?
124149619252_156053474470:My fav food is Chipotle & I try to bring it home once a week. Add Delivery to Colorado locations and it would be heaven as I would order all the time!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl: White rice, pinto beans, a little bit of chicken, extra corn, extra cheese, and lettuce :) Yum yum yum
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito. white rice, black beans, double chicken, corn, peppers, sour cream, double hot sauce, cheese!!!!!
124149619252_10152250518069253:you should have some thing like this. I've been too afraid to go back to chipotle after the ecoli scare
124149619252_164816057005566:I DON'T LIKE TOFU OR VEGETARIANS (because only vegetarians can eat tofu) SO I'M GOING TO LOUDLY PROCLAIM MY VENDETTA AGAINST THEM AND CHIPOTLE. LOOK AT ME. I HAVE AN OPINION. I'M SO ANGRY THAT PEOPLE CAN GET TOFU IN THEIR BURRITOS EVEN IF I DON'T HAVE TO. I'M AFRAID OF CHANGE SO I'M GOING TO BE MAD.  (I understand the people who think soy is bad for you: if you eat it in moderation, you're not going to get all the cancer. At least Chipotle is making it GMO free soy! And you still don't have to eat it yourself if it isn't your thing!)
124149619252_10150672519564253:seriously! or at least preferate them so it is easier to tear. because you know that is why you only fill them up right below the halfway point of the bag.
124149619252_10151486609219253:Here it is. The Spooky Special! Black Beans, Rice, half  Barbacoa, half steak, cheese, lettuce, corn, sour cream and the key that pulls it together smoked chipotle tabasco sauce!
124149619252_10153374669409253:Hey, I was just there on Sunday!  And people were incredulous that I'd go to Chipotle in Paris.  Little did they know that it was full of Parisians.  :)
124149619252_10153112208029253:The only problem I've had with the tacos is the smash and stuff them into the wrapper and by the time I open it to eat it its all broken and smashed and falling apart and is a huge mess and at that point I'm eating nachos. Maybe figure out a different way to package up the tacos?
124149619252_10150256700954253:Besides the fact that you have the absolute best tasting food, you are socially responsible. I know that I am going to get a gluten free meal! And I am going to get food that is farm raised, no antibiotics, and organic. It can't get better than that. Your restaurants in Omaha are also so generous with donations it is so amazing thanks and Happy Birthday!
124149619252_10152108930454253:shee pow tleh ( Chipotle).....just like that! and thanks for closing thats why i love to work at Chipotle!

124149619252_10153009001449253:Chipotle Mexican Grill very disappointed with this promotion. All the restaurants I went to were out of sofritas!! I think maybe you guys were just trying to get rid of sofritas. No chipotle for me on this Monday.
124149619252_122372141178171:What does Jamie Oliver say about your burritos?  They are delicious but have waaaaay too many caolories and WW points.
124149619252_10151024826814253:bowl with brown rice, both beans,corn salsa,chicken, hot salsa,cheese,sour cream, vinagret...hmm that's it, now I want some! 
124149619252_10151089035244253:Appleton, WI...they recognize us coming in! Jon Kahananui - I don't think McDonald's has anything to do with them anymore.

124149619252_10152881174584253:Now I know why CMG is $641.52! A little pricey, but worth it. All you need to do is order, pick it up and bring drinks!
124149619252_182078509223:Why don't you open a restaurant in Vienna, Austria, we need a Chipotle here!  Not just one, 2, 3, or even 4.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Joe because of this fake coupon it actually work for a marketing tool they brought me to your page so I can like it now but I am disappointed that it was fake 
124149619252_10153281032634253:This is the best post I've seen all week. Augusten Burroughs is awesome. Next they should do David Sedaris

124149619252_10150942028479253:Frigid - at least at the NYC 6th ave and 14th st location.  Turn down the AC!!! Food is getting cold too fast!
124149619252_10153799431059253:Do you have any slim solutions on the menu? I need to shed some pounds in 2016 and Chipotle is sooo good. :O
124149619252_10153888324619253:I used to eat here twice a week man but now I think twice about eating here.  How are you going to win my trust back ever?
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl more white rice, less chicken, black beans, mild salsa, corn, lettuce and cilantro! Delish I heart chipotle 
124149619252_10151658877254253:Sorry to hear that Brad Wildman, and we'll make sure to check up on our locations there to get them up to speed. And you know it Nathaniel Larson! - Joe
124149619252_267832333301923:donation is donation, to bribe people w/ a free burrito and the price tag for the lunch bag is a total rip off... that just ain't right... sigh! so sad... :(
124149619252_205455487672:I will stop by this resturant at least once every two months even if I have to catch a train down from the University of Edinburgh!
124149619252_205082546217004:Ya know, my family and I love Chipotle. But every time I see or remember you are owned by McDonalds, I die a little inside. :/ I wish it wasn't so.
124149619252_10152354297542741:I totally watched it. Thank you for expanding to Philadelphia International Airport. Biggest fan. Tee-hee! (free burrito please)
124149619252_10151826977069253:This seriously made my day! After eating chipotle every week in the US I've had serious cravings since I've been in Europe! Can't wait to visit next time I go to Frankfurt for work!
124149619252_10150262089049253:We need one here in Scottsboro Alabama asap. We moved.from Ohio We miss ur food sooooo bad.  Plz put one here.....ill run it....I have ten yrs restaurant management experience..........
124149619252_10153236016399253:I don't know what Indolent means, but I'm not taking the time to look it up, I like Chipotle. Transportation is limited, so I'd be willing to try their delivery option !!
124149619252_10153878506969253:My local chipotle has been out of corn, Lettuce, beans, bowels and cheese for the past 3 weeks. Why pay full price when you can't get all you want in your burrito?
124149619252_10153602183249253:Whoever photoshopped this not only to be insulting but also to put you guys in a bad place is a disgusting human being. I think he or she should make a public apology.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Melissa Avalos we were just talking about sofritas lol...ok I will try because I get something for free next time haha
124149619252_10151089035244253:Any location where the employees serving aren't new and don't skimp on the ingredients;  it's BOWLSHIT!  <3
124149619252_10152773616059253:Boo. Don't give in to the uneducated woo-pushing Luddites. Your burritos are better than Moe's, Baja Fresh, or Q'Doba - but I'll have to go there from now on I guess.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Why? Not like there's anything wrong with it. It's just a way to make food easier to produce. If the world wasn't over populated it wouldn't be such a problem
124149619252_10153514914799253:You clearly haven't been to the Duluth, MN Chipotle. They constantly forget chips & guac and make burritos via order wrong. The GM and Apprentice need a wake up call. ITS NOT THAT HARD!
124149619252_10151611917404253:Chipotle is awesome had it severs places we just got one here in Huntsville alabama back a year ago I am glad I can go get it now without driving to far lol
124149619252_244957752262179:What really!  There's going to be Chipotle in Austin!  Telling my friends in Kingsville, TX for sure!
124149619252_159372559415:they dont have kids meals in columbus... i am jealous , kinda of hard to take my son there he loves it but makes a huge mess
124149619252_10152949800154253:That's great that you'll be giving your employees time off! Good thing I picked it up for dinner tonight!
124149619252_10150399959924253:They were better costumes than that. no offense  to  the winners, they did a good job. I just saw some others that did a better job.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Sofritas (shredded, spiced tofu) is now available in #Chipotle restaurants nationwide. Heres to the availability of vegan food everywhere! http://bit.ly/1ujim1n
124149619252_10150256700954253:turned some new people on to Chipotle last week and they were surprised how much you got and how good it was for how much money you paid. Def not their usual fast food and they are going back on their own!  I got no prob with the price hike, just keep the goodness coming! Happy Birthday, glad you exist!
124149619252_10150942028479253:Mild and medium green....       Sour cream or cheese??????       Both please and guacamole and I know it is xtra... <3 the chipotle way!!!!!!!
124149619252_10153896327714253:Thanks Chipolte for the free burrito coupon you offered last week. It allowed me to buy a burrito, bowl, salad or whatever I wanted for FREE.  What a great company.
124149619252_10152250518069253:You should thank the people who made the fake post.. How many people went in today because of this, Joe?
124149619252_10152748433069253:Darling Jennie   .... the first 2 words are THIS HALLOWEEN.... which is October 31st, if you weren't sure!

124149619252_109031815838831:I got a free burrito for waiting to check out. I waited for no longer than 1 minute. They didn't have to but they did. But I never stop going back. Why? Customer service matters to this company. Without a doubt. Way to go guys. 
124149619252_10153150981964253:Chipotle is way over priced and thier employees are rude...until at least those things change, I won't eat there.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Hard/soft/burrito/bowl with brown rice, no beans, chicken, mild and medium sauce, lots of corn, sour cream, and cheese!
124149619252_10150262089049253:You need to put a chipotle in Wenatchee Washington. You'll make alot of money and I can eat chipotle again

124149619252_10152883478794253:don't have to worry about me ordering anything anymore, disrespect those who put their lives on the line for us everyday and you guys can just rot in hell.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Brown rice, fajita veggies, black beans, mild, med and corn salsa, cheese, extra lettuce and guac on the side! Then I add tabasco :)
124149619252_10151024826814253:my order has to be as follows... double wrapped burrito with white rice, carnitas, pinto beans, corn, lettuce, a SMALL amount of tomato( too much = a runny burrito), sour cream, cheese, and a dab of guac. and i need the best wrapper to wrap that 7LB baby!
124149619252_10151251776579253:I have petitioned for a chipotle in Stuttgart Germany several times but I wont move there till they get one although im sure ill be pressured  into it.  ....living in the US
124149619252_10153246130479253:Keep it up!!!  You are my favorite restaurant for sure!!  And for those who don't understand the consequences - take a look at this article: https://medium.com/natural-resources-defense-council/tortilla-reform-53117f2d96db
124149619252_10151258924194253:Its good to see that some companies are still honoring THANKSGIVING day.   I will visit the restaurant more often
124149619252_228034027252006:We will be there! My kiddos are already planning on dressing up as farmers, so this will be the healthiest stop during our trick-or-treating. Thanks, Chipotle!
124149619252_10153708605069253:At there today, rice was a lil crunchy so I don't think it was cooked enough but still amazing and can't wait until my next meal there
124149619252_10151251776579253:Unfortunately, you only have the option to hit "Like" once.  However, given the oportunity, I would "Like, Like" Chipotle to be the only food I eat.
124149619252_130482563683418:Baja Fresh, QDoba and Chipotle all tast the same to me. But for some reason Chipotle always has more people there. I think it's your spicy salsa that wins people over.
124149619252_10152250518069253:I've had free Chipotle before...that's how I got introduced..  But...$6 for my favorite burrito is nothing. I'm still going
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl: white rice, carnitas, lots of fresh tomatoes, sour cream and lettuce! I eat it AT LEAST once a week.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl, white rice, black beans, mild and hot salsa, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce.  That was last night's dinner :).
124149619252_454413931302356:Joe Mellon has an interesting view of reality. Chic-Fil-A moderators were rude and immediately ban anyone opposing them, the Chipotle team has been awesome and respectful to all. The picture of the "lines wrapped around the side of the buildings" on that "great day" will likely show up in the history books in 20 years and be akin to the pictures of "whites only signs"  to demonstrate discrimination. The next generations will wonder why people fought to impose their beliefs on others and be ashamed of their ancestors for their bigotry.
124149619252_109031815838831:Love Chipotle, and my wonderful husband likes to pick it up for us both each Friday after work,  but the chipotle team always forgets to give him the salad dressing when he orders me a salad. It would be great service if you could remember to ask if we would like the dressing along with the salad and put it in the bag before I discover none when it arrives home! lol : )
124149619252_10152250518069253:Yeah nice way to fix that problem...don't worry now no one will want to BUY anything from you either when you are rude about it. Being someone who's job is to make the public happy or advertise or whatever you should know better than yup write it in the rude way you did. I understand it's a scam and I get it I'm not upset about that but because of how you worded this I'm gonna go get big city burrito tonight instead of you, cuz hey they are nicer, and better anyways
124149619252_10152805746454253:Chicken, white rice (half portion), black beans, fajita veggies, mild salsa, little bit of sour cream, guac and lettuce. In a bowl :)
124149619252_157777224183:HI! I'M BILLY MAYS FOR CHIPOTLE-AWAY!! Got bloodstains in your underwear from eating Chipotle? Chipotle-away gets them right out!
124149619252_10153118469724253:That's so weird I just started reading Coehlos book the Alchemist today then my favorite restaurant is quoting him! Now I want a burrito :(
124149619252_10153246130479253:Looking at the majority of the comments. The guy in the marketing department that came up with this idea for publicity needs a raise.
124149619252_10152250518069253:No worries, I'm awaiting your posting about the idiotic guacamole comment.  Of course the cost of it could go up, but the cost of all your foods (particularly cheese and dairy-based products) also goes up tremendous with the rise in the cost of fuel--yet I don't see you whining about fracking and moving to a natural gas fleet.
124149619252_10151089035244253:El Paso, TX because there isn't one in Las Cruces, where I live. El Paso is about 40 minutes away. You would think the Mexican food in New Mexico but it is not so I have to drive to Chipotle in El Paso
124149619252_10152883505569253:Does chipotle choose it's locations based on proximity to farmers markets and is there any stats on this?
124149619252_284168885010421:My wife and I check into Chipotle every time we're there.  I've gotten the badge, but she has not yet.  And it's been maybe 5 times in this time frame.  Any idea why?
124149619252_160584150738666:I love all the "There's Chipotle in Paris but not Middle-of-Nowhere, USA?  WTF, how can this be?"  Although honestly I can't imagine the Parisians being able to stomach that much food at once.  I had Chipotle about  a week after moving back to America from Western Europe and I was stuffed alllll day, and it was the only thing I had eaten that day.
124149619252_10152883478794253:I'm in love with Chipotle Mexican Grill we are getting married soon...I'm going to have him every night.....LOL
124149619252_10150256700954253:Happy Birthday Chipotle!  Please come to Chardon OH so I don't have to drive so far.  It is, however, worth the drive!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa, 1/2 black beans, 1/2 onions and peppers, lettuce, pico de gallo, a little bit of salsa verde, lots of cheese, and sour cream.
124149619252_10153009001449253:How many hipsters are excited for tofu?! Raise your hand. I'll just buy a burrito. Tofu should have never existed. Period
124149619252_10151719407409253:Seriously disappointed! I researched the ads online and was going back and forth filling in the words and I was unable to submit because I "needed logged in again".
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito bowl - white rice , black beans , onions , corn , salsa and topped with sour cream!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito: brown rice, black beans, barbacoa, mild, sour cream & cheese, guacamole and lettuce. Heaven in a tortilla. Yum.
124149619252_10153246130479253:What about teaching your cooks how to cut meat properly.  Mine is always mostly fat...  Was throwing more away than eating..  Now I just order a rice salad.  >.<
124149619252_10153232136249253:Oh wow you treat them so nice before you slaughter and eat them. How nice :) I bet the pigs are really happy about it
124149619252_10151058843154253:So, we have established two things, 1) Chipotle is NOT owned by McDonalds (I already knew that) 2) this particular Chipotle (the one in the picture above) is in Gurnee, IL
124149619252_228034027252006:Nobody is going to do this, who the hell wants to dress up like that? Yeah sure, lets go spend FOURTY TO SIXTY OR MORE on a ridiculously stupid costume so we can save 5 dollars on our burritos...screw that. So guess what Chipotle  QDOBA HERE I COME! You lost a customer.
124149619252_10153395310879253:For everyone spending time on Facebook complaining about a burrito company, you might also want to close your Facebook account.... Facebook, Inc. is also pro-equality.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Can you stop serving burritos with ingredients that have been grown by redheaded farm hands?  Ginger poisoning is a real thing!  Do your research!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl, brown rice (if any), black beans, chicken, mild salsa, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, and GUAC. Cannot resist the GUAC. Wish I was at Chipotle right now!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Beware of negative comments with many "likes": GMOs are big money! Supporters will band together and try to mislead. Thank you, Chipotle!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:I always ask for 4 times the corn they normally put on. And then when they're done i'll go "More please :)"
124149619252_10153096213679253:Lorenzo Valdivia Tyler Meredith Aria Mantz I don't know about you guys but I'm going to the Kansas one
124149619252_10151024826814253:Double wrapped burrito brown rice, barbacoa, fajitas, hot and medium salsa, extra sour cream, lettuce, and cheese
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken fajita bowl with white rice, extra fajita ,black beans,fresh tomato,extra corn salsa, medium salsa,sour cream, lettuce and guacamole to top it off!!! I so miss it!!!!!
124149619252_10153013362654253:You just opened up one in Mechanicsburg pa and I'm thinking of checking it out tonight, the Harrisburg and camp hill locations are nice
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito: No rice, black beans (double), chicken (double), red hot salsa, light sour cream, cheese and lettuce.
124149619252_10153066985824253:you guys need to put one near plymouth MA area there are already 4 near the Boston which is about 45 mins away
124149619252_164816057005566:I may try it. But I always go back to my standard Carnitas bowl. We need a Chipotle in Hanvover MA! Plenty of space for one.
124149619252_10151839071994253:Ricarda Angela if you guys cone visit me in November we need to go there. A starbucks is across from it. That would be an awesome place to have a reunion.
124149619252_156053474470:Forget everywhere else, please put a Chipotle in Pleasanton or Livermore, California! We love the place and need one in both of those places!
124149619252_10150672519564253:I tried to creat a burritoful world, but apparently I don't have the right kind of soil or something. . .
124149619252_10152250518069253:it should be free for the baby portions you guys put in the burrito bowl and want us to pay extra for a table spoon of meat if we want more.
124149619252_279121798773401:Living the typical overworked and stressed lives we all lead, chipotle has provided me with a good fast meal option. It offers the quality ingredients I would purchase myself, with the convenience of fast food. You guys rock, whoever is managing Chipotle is doing a hell of a job. Keep up the delicious work.
124149619252_10152724330769253:#chiplotle please! Please teach!! Teach! Your guys so they can learn! How to roll a burrito! Is unbelievable how most of them are Mexicans but don't know how to do that? Thanks.
124149619252_10152935096524253:Everyone!! This is going to sound CRAZY!! BUT if you stop asking for extra everything else, I found that they actually put a good amount of everything on PLUS THIS MUCH GUAC. And what's even better....IT CAN ALL FIT IN A BURRITO! WOAAAHHHH MIND BLOOOWNNNN!!! :O
124149619252_10153246130479253:Every major scientific body and regulatory agency in the world has concluded GMO products are safe. I have no issue with offering options, but when you condemn traditional agriculture and infer that GMO products are less safe or less healthful than non-GMO, that's where you are using a hot three-letter acronym to boost your bottom line. That ain't right and I'll stick to Qdoba.
124149619252_10152949800154253:The only thing I need to know is if the employee still works for Chipotle?  If so then that is an unspoken admission of support (regardless of your words) for the actions taken while on company time because what your employees do at work DOES reflect on what the company allows and if the person who disrespected those who risk their lives daily still wears your uniform then you are saying is that what they did was fine.  ACTIONS speak louder than words!  Does the disrespectful jerk still have a job with you?
124149619252_130916887010628:so, is it only for ppl who dress up in a costume? does it have to be a costume in particular? & are all chipotle's honoring this?
124149619252_10153656854824253:Chipotle Mexican Grill is one of the few reasonably priced fast foods with decent salads in the Bay Area. Lunch is often $15 or more here.
124149619252_162705813797304:Ate for the first time at Chipotle last weekend.  had the rice bowl burrito thing - extremely yummy.  Where can I get me some coupons for more...?
124149619252_10153656854824253:Brandon since you said you've never had guac, I thought you should check this out and decide if you'll like it or not, haha
124149619252_10153246130479253:still waiting on you to unveil this time machine you have, thats the only way you are going to get genetically unaltered crop seed............
124149619252_10151024826814253:Wtf chipotle, just came from there, barbacoa hard shells with tomato salasa, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, GUAC, and one of your heavy margaritas.... WOOT!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Chipolte in Grove City, OH. It's awesome, they get you through the line fast and have a great burrito!
124149619252_10153246130479253:And then people will start complaining bc the food isn't esthetically pleasing to the eye bc of the no GMO it's never ending.
124149619252_10151826977069253:did they really screw up the burrito? cause I am american wanting to drive 3 hours from south eastern bavaria just for a taste of what I love... tell me its worth it please
124149619252_100780796665922:Lived in Ohio where we ate at Chipotle all the time.  Moved back to PA.  My husband works in State college, where he had to go to Qdoba until you opened a Chipotle.  Now he has all of his work friends (except one) going to Chipotle.  They don't even go to Qdoba any more.
124149619252_520689341285681:People dont knock Tofu until you have tasted it. Prepared properly it is a wonderful addition to any meal.
124149619252_10151058843154253:Read the question, people.  Not "where is the first Chipotle?" but "where is THIS specific Chipotle, which is the first restaurant to be Platinum LEED certified?"  Besides, if you're so proud of Denver being home to the first Chipotle, why haven't you gone there?  Because the Evans location definitely doesn't look like this.
124149619252_10152250518069253:I think someone should have had the decency to tell me the luncheon was free. To make someone run out with potato salad in his hand, pretending hes throwing up, is not what I call hospitality.-Jack Handey
124149619252_10152323527922741:Mike Pack Goodyear I think this our chance for a big break for that documentary of a Chipotle worker...
124149619252_10151895014639253:Emily Bordt Cadmus is correct, although technically Silverthorne would have been better. Nice work! When you get a chance, private message us. - Joe
124149619252_10151024826814253:Carnitas burrito bowl - brown rice black beans onions and peppers, tomatoes, corn, sour cream cheese and lettuce!

124149619252_10150959152619253:Aahh this one is in Dulles and it serves BREAKFAST!!! We need that in the other Chipotles! I don't want to have to book a flight every time I need that amazing chorizo/hash brown/egg burrito bol!
124149619252_10150987384894253:WOW! do I miss Chipotle Mexican Grill Burritos and tacos! It has been over 20 months since my last burrito, and I hope to fall of the wagon in July.
124149619252_212886842115332:o chipotle how I miss thee..... I will be visiting you in 6 1/2 months after I get married. Until then I have to say ado
124149619252_10153246130479253:Can anyone tell me exactly what a GMO does in your body that makes it bad for you? And citing some supporting links (not Oz, Mercola or NaturalNews) would be nice.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Anyone claiming 'GMO phobia' is a joke, is a clown. We have right to not want GMOs. Good for them for attempting this.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I literally won a 300 dollar catering from chipotle. It was freaking awesome. We fed 3 families and we were all super full and there was still food left over lol
124149619252_10152883504929253:8 more days and after a year of waiting I can finally have my  Double wrapped steak burrito with black beans, white rice, fajitas, tomatillo salsa, sour cream, lettuce and cheese! With a bag of chips and 4 extra sides of tomatillo salsa!  Since my flight arrives late on Thursday you better believe that ill be waiting at the door before it opens!
124149619252_109031815838831:love Chipotle, never had a bad experience, always looks and is clean, they gladly give extras, although you do have to pay for extra meat (which is fair!) and i too have been gifted a burrito on occasion, just because.  that has never happened to me at any other 'fast food' place.
124149619252_10153903490999253:You must give a little to gain much. Do the right thing Chipotle. Show your fans how much you appreciate. A Chipotle loyalty rewards card/buy 1 burrito, get 2 free.
124149619252_109031815838831:Chipotle is delicious. There are not that many places I can say I would eat at everyday. Chipotle is one place I could (and have) mmm maybe Chipotle for lunch now...
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl, brown rice, black beans, double fajita, chicken/steak half/half, mild, med, corn, sour cream, cheese and lettuce!! YUM! With a side of guac and chips, best meal everrrrrr!!!!
124149619252_209217239092800:Uh Oh..I don't think they will be fast enough.  I've seen the line out the door for lunch and dinner @ Chipotle.  The one where I live is always packed with people.
124149619252_10151053134024253:Well it will be Jeffersonville Indiana, or Louisville Kentucky  if you guys will ever build one near me     -__- I'm having withdrawals here that Qdoba doesn't satisfy
124149619252_10152004082504253:Kind of funny to have some cretin whining about English on a website devoted to a MEXICAN grille. Hey, Rocky, stay at McDonald's will ya?
124149619252_10153212525009253:Kristina Huffman Gracie WashburnKelly Alexis Brinson I'm going to this cause my favorite band will be there but thought I would show you! it involves food maybe you can join me for a bit haha
124149619252_10153009001449253:People are so closed minded. I only eat the Sofritas but many I know refused to try them because they're made with tofu. They were pleasantly surprised when it tasted like meat.
124149619252_10152408378957741:It's just good old fashioned advertising. How else can you sell 800 calorie burritos and be viewed as a "healthy eating" company? :P
124149619252_10151024826814253:steak,black beans extra white rice pico and extra hot sauce cheese sour cream and lettuce maybe guacamole if im in the mood
124149619252_199537401806:Next state? How bout next block! More Chipotles in Dallas, TX ASAP! More Chipotles, less McDonalds! Chipotle in the hood! Woot woot!
124149619252_10152935096524253:I make better Mexican food at home, less fat, less salt, more flavor! My stepson used to work for Chipitotl and learned a few things about their recipes that I improved upon. #isupportthethinblueline
124149619252_10153009001449253:If I order two sofritas at one transaction, does that mean I will get two free burrito on my next visit? Chipotle Mexican Grill
124149619252_10152864893019253:That helps, but it seems a rather large percentage of your employees are still very bad at wrapping burritos, even when the foil trick is used, all too often they still fall apart before I'm finished.    Better training is needed in your stores.
124149619252_10152236327209253:Missing these in Arizona...the Southwest...ideal demographic for your Southwestern vegan customer base.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thank you! As a nutritionist this means a lot to me! One day people are going to realize the truth about GMOs I just hope it won't be too late..

124149619252_221129944611968:LOL!  I love how people commenting on the article site are comparing Chipotle to Taco Bell....say what???  Have you eaten at Chipotle???  LOL
124149619252_359374267426678:@Kasey: You will have to fight me for the mayor position. @Ray: A coupon would be more highly conveted than a badge. Now if a badge translate into coupon glora!!!!!! I am crazy about the rice, I could eat it everyday!
124149619252_10151486609219253:Brown rice, chicken, onions & peppers, corn salsa and cheeeeese :)  Yum!  Prefer it all in a bowl though.. and in Murfreesboro, TN.. hint hint!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Honestly...the new designs are TERRIBLE....how plain, unfinished and un inviting!!!!   Come on guys, you're way better than that.  Tell Steve to get some new glasses!!!!

124149619252_130482563683418:i e-mailed chipotle last tues after having bad service both times i was at the sandusky ohio location. last tuesday my husband had a steak burrito and the meat was completely RAW. haven't heard anything from chipotle yet.
124149619252_10150300340834253:This looks like an amazing concept. Now finish your website but include a lot of the photos from your trip to Asia! I hope this will expand quickly as I'm dying to try it.
124149619252_10151611917404253:Wow right next to Univ of Denver. 3 things for a business to be successful: Location, Location, Location!!!!
124149619252_215673425111837:As a former employee I can say the recipe that's won the taste buds of a lot of people won't change because some one doesn't like it.  
124149619252_10151024826814253:Sometimes burrito with black beans, sometimes taco without black beans. I get steak,cheese, lettuce, fresh salsa, sour creme. and occasionally guac.
124149619252_10151809543439253:I had the luck to try the sofritas! They are a great idea, I absolutely love when more vegetarian options are available, but imo they're just a tad too spicy.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Wow, to all the people that feel entitled because some idiot not associated with Chipolte created a fake ad. Chipolte does run special offers for Halloween and other random occasions. "There is no such thing as a free lunch" is a quote that has been around for years. Thank you Chipotle for being one of the few places you can go to eat that doesn't sell garbage. They are not cheapskates, they serve quality food (which costs money).
124149619252_10152407734029253:Yeah...my life no longer includes Chipotle.  Sad...I actually liked you guys.  I mean, you're no Taco Bell, but I did enjoy you guys.
124149619252_10153602183249253:Smfh.... photoshop + trolls it happens people who believe bs like this. Now I'm feeling a burrito bowl because I personally don't side with idiots who believe in pr disasters like this.

I agree it is your right to set what ever standards you feel is best for your operations and with that same belief I hope you understand as for I and my family we will no longer be customers. Please also know that I feel it only fair to allow all of my friends to make an informed decision as well. Chipotle Mexican Grill

124149619252_10151892810414253:Congrats to all the winners. Chipotle Mexican Grill are the winners contacted via email? I see my first name but I live in a metropolitan city.
124149619252_10152805746454253:quesarito - brown, black, veggies, half sofritas, half chicken, everything except guacamole, plus cilantro.
124149619252_10152853394299253:Chipotle you guys chose the wrong person. The sauron costume was much better and it wa unbelievably well made. What did this guy do? duct tape and face paint.
124149619252_160584150738666:They have one in Paris but they dont have one in West Virginia they NEED to make on WVU students would love you forever
124149619252_10153246130479253:What's wrong with GMOs? We've been genetically modifying food for centuries. Only science has made the process faster and easier.

124149619252_10152262999499253:Please, please, please launch in NC asap! And while you're at it, please plan a store nearer to Concord, NC. Thanks!
124149619252_10153589344059253:I can never eat at Chipotle for my lunch break because the lines are to long. I only have 30 minutes.
124149619252_10153009001449253:BRING CHIPOTLE DOWN TO FORT SMITH ARKANSAS!!!!!!!!! I'm going through withdrawal!!!!!!!!!!! Pllllllllllllllllllllleas
124149619252_10151024826814253:I start with a bowl, 1/2 lettuce 1/2 brown rice, 1/2 pinto beans 1/2 black beans, double chicken, double pico de galleo (tomato salsa), corn, a little cheese, guacamole, and finish with lettuce on top. Yumm.
124149619252_156053474470:Our small town (Silverthorne, CO) recently got a Chipotle  AND a Qdoba... if one delivered, that would be a BIG advantage over the other... especially in a resort area where a lot of the visitors don't have transportation.  They get pizza delivered all the time, I am sure burrito delivery would be a hit!
124149619252_363324750372027:I work at chipolte in palm springs, ca and I ride a bus 1hr 45min each way, and its well worth the free burrito I get every morning! Talking 3 hrs is to far to drive! Yeah right, chipolte wants to change the way people see fast food! Great job chipolte!!
124149619252_10153236016399253:I need to know how we can get delivery started in South Bend, Indiana. This is incredibly important to myself and Molly Hunter-Asherman.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Still fast-food , when I want great Mexican I go to this place called La Unica , where actual Mexicans prepare and cook your food
124149619252_10150959152619253:Dulles airport. When I flew out of there... I was amazed chipotle was open at 6 am. I was tempted to have a burrito breakfast
124149619252_10153009001449253:Chipotle is killing me. I always order sofritas,  and would love to be able to get a free burrito on my next visit. Why do I have to be out of the country when this awesome deal is going on? >_<
124149619252_10151719407409253:Filled this one out at least 10 times, correctly I might add... words keep duping in the dropdown lists and it says "Try Again". I've tried in Firefox, Chrome and IE. I even resorted to spoiler websites to make sure I had the correct answers, and I did.
124149619252_10151251776579253:Chipotle :  While you don't serve the pork.... There should be a chicken that IS NOT SO HOT....everyone doesn't enjoy spicy foods!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito with brown rice, peppers and onions, steak, pinto beans, green salsa, tomato, corn, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce! :)
124149619252_10153693560944253:I have emailed your company about healthy and safety in your restaurants your comments were condensing and did not address my food safety concerns. It is good to that someone's concerns are being address for the first time the sad fact is it took a E. coli outbreak to address them. Your company needs to be proactive not reactive.
124149619252_10153009001449253:To bad the "carnitas" has been recalled and taken off the menu!!! ???????? Joanna Dean, tofu! Right up your alley
124149619252_10153878506969253:Really Chipotle? You just texted me Here's ur (sic) free burrito". Start acting professional if you want us to start trusting you again. Keep ur burrito. I just lost my appetite.
124149619252_10153734396969253:Never would eat there. The employees looked so revolting with tattoos, piercings, ear rings, nose rings, lip rings and greasy hair, I just could not order. I had to leave,
124149619252_10153112208029253:Esto  jamas se podrá comparar con la verdadera comida mexicana, de tan solo verlo me da tristeza que piensen que esto es un taco.
124149619252_10152925087634253:I got severe food poisoning from eating a Chipotle chicken burrito. My husband was sick too! All day throwing up violently on Christmas Eve. One of the worst days of my life. Luckily my 9 month old didn't get sick, I had given him some rice and guacamole from the burrito. Thanks a LOT Chipotle!! We'll never be eating there again!!!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Gramercy, NYC. Food is always fresh. Staff works really hard! Lisa the manager insures that my food is on point. Give that woman a promotion already!!
124149619252_10151626575004253:i miss chipotole so much! i had eaten 2-3 times a week in my ny days. please come into tokyo. i can tell a few good places for your first shop. ;-))
124149619252_10153246130479253:Hey Buddy, there are hundreds if not thousands of foods that are not organic that are still non GMO. We're sick and tired of eating GMO's so label them.
124149619252_10151839071994253:Omg thanks Hanne Bjørglund!! I'm definitely planning a shopping trip to frankfurt soon! But heading to America in November anyway!
124149619252_10152250518069253:yup was already planning to take the office lunch buddies (retracting emails) but noooooo not now... almost had me going to! haha
124149619252_10150959152619253:Dulles Airport! I eat there before I leave the country and first thing when I get back! Oh, and also... Breakfast burritos Chipotle style are amazing! 
124149619252_10153389325099253:Joplin Mo or Overland Park Ks depends on where I am traveling... Would love to have a Chipotle in Pittsburg Ks so I didn't have to travel for it... Hint hint. ;)
124149619252_10153246130479253:Basically no gmo's results in a higher cost to buy the corn and wheat used. So now it's more expensive. But it's worth it ????
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl with white rice, black beans, fajitas, and cheese with chips and a large drink. That is my order almost every time.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Why would you propagate such paranoid nonsense? What's next, banning employees from being vaccinated?  This makes me seriously second guess giving you my money. 
124149619252_10151839071994253:Susi Zurin Hanne Bjørglund Sina Hllmnn Tatjana Nagel Paulo Rothe Victoria Zerbe Linda Scheibe we have to go to frankfurt :-D !!!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito with white rice, black beans, corn salsa, sour cream, and cheese.  Yes, I know that's the signature item; I started eating it years ago :)
124149619252_10152560126959253:Burrito bowl- vegetarian; white rice, black beans, tomato salsa, corn salsa, sour cream, cheese, & guac with a side of medium sauce ????
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito bowl...black beans, mild salsa, cheese and sour cream....lots of lettuce....so yummo!
124149619252_10153246130479253:If GMO's are so safe then way did  the biotech industry pay the Obama Admin. $5M to put in the farm bill that they can not be sued for GMO safety? Answer: because they know GMO's are not safe, just like the tobacco industry knew their products were not safe.
124149619252_205013139622238:Oh god Matt Lauer is one of those jerks who can't pronounce Chipotle. He puts the L before the T. What the hell is wrong with these people? Bobby Flay does it too, and he says chipotle like every 5 seconds so it's even worse.
124149619252_175763983493:Zach. Its a hole in the ozone, not whole. Read up on Captain Green Al Gore who promoted green living while owning a Zinc mine that was polluting the environment. You should read up on the research from the other side before you make statements about the thousands of reports by scientists. The UN report that is quoted by Gore and the rest of the green Nazis was misquoted, you should read it. There is a big difference in the words MAY and IS, when you attach a word like caused to them. Got to love how the only way to stop global warming is by raising taxes.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Really pissed! Went to my chipotle, there was a line halfway through the store (I figured there would be) after waiting 20 min, they said they are out and it would be another 45 -1hr. I left and people I met outside said they said that over an hr ago. If u r going to do something like this you need to have enough. Or offer something else. So many people left....
124149619252_10153792851004253:They just hatin on Chipotle. They will always be the best. The only reason they getting all this hate is because they never had any food issues before. Leave Chipotle alone!
124149619252_205082546217004:While GUAC is high in fat - you do need some fat in your diet and it is good fat (2g of saturated fat) - it is one of the higher calorie items on the menu @130 per serving but you can alsways ask for half a serving - which is one of the reasons I love chipotle - I can actually split my meal into two servings and it is a reasonable amount of calories, carbs, fats, etc. - I do this because a whole meal is probably twice what we should be eating.
124149619252_10151086390274253:Who loves Chipolte more the Brits or the USA?  You should have a Burrito Olympics after this one is over.  Most burritos eaten, fastest time for eating a burrito and more! :)  Good Luck to Misty Mae and Kerri!
124149619252_157777224183:Sweet, I can't wait to pay higher prices for green "technology" rather than for grass-fed/better quality meats and/or more organic ingredients. 
124149619252_10152883505569253:u removed pork.. bad idea mate.. i never go here and i prob never. luky i dont have to eat that insane burrrito lke that...
124149619252_10151486609219253:double wrapped, extra rice, double steak extra fajitas, lettuce, cheese, pico, sour cream....every single time
124149619252_10151024826814253:FAV: Chicken burrito- extra chicken, white rice, pinto beans, cheese, sour cream, and the corn salsa.  give me 2 for the road!!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak or barbacoa, white rice, pintos, cheese, verde salsa, and corn. You guys really need a queso dip on the side, btw.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak Burrito: White Rice, Corn salsa, Fresh Salsa, cheese, sour cream, lettuce. Chips with Corn salsa as the dip.
124149619252_10151719407409253:Usually, when you roll something this good, its illegal The happy pill, now in a 567,000mg dose Open wide, no wider The gourmet restaurant where you eat with your hands They beep when they backup
124149619252_166838126748689:I love Chipotle. Only drawback is that it's spendy for "fastfood". By the time I add the Guacamole(additional $1.90), my burrito bowl is up to $10 with NO drink.
124149619252_140229971715:Yes, bring it to California too....especially San Diego!  I just brought my girls with me this week to eat there and was bummed there were no kids meals!
124149619252_10153013362654253:I am so grateful for your remote locations. Sometimes you're the only vegan option for a hundred miles.
124149619252_10153009001449253:When a vegetarian says they are horrible, you have to give them away. I'll plan on sticking to my burritos.
124149619252_160584150738666:Oh yea you guys can put a Chipotle in Paris but you can put one on the island of Oahu? Tell me how this makes sense, that I have to go so long without sweet sweet Chipotle, but the Frenchies get it.....
124149619252_10151024826814253:Double carnitas burrito, pintos, rice, little bit of cheese, corn salsa, medium salsa and guac!!! Mmmmm I'm droolin ova here ;-)
124149619252_10153530958859253:The teen workers could care less about GMOs. The manager of the Chipotle franchise in my town owns GMO crop ground and raises livestock fed GMO grain. It's all a facade...hypocrites designed to get your dollar in their pocket. Period!
124149619252_130482563683418:Although CMG is good... I like the various "-bertos" in the arizona market.  And I support local minority owned businesses by being their patron.  Buy Local - Avoid Chains!  Support your local capitalist living the american dream!!!
124149619252_10151316869709253:I'm staying home and making pulled pork, collards, and blackeyed peas, anyways. Hope the folks enjoy the day off!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Wow, the astroturfers are all over this.... Crazy. http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/04/26/media-obstruction-intimidation-harassment.aspx
124149619252_10150260445594253:***Added to say: at Mission Burrito, they don't have "paper" punch cards. They are hard plastic like a credit card and they swipe them the same way they'd swipe a credit card or gift card and it keeps track of them that way. In the long run, it's probably cheaper to do it that way rather than a bunch of paper ones but nonetheless, it's a nice incentive and a sweet little surpise when they say "you can get a free burrito today or on your next visit."
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken bureto bowl with extra rice, peppers & onions, mild tomato salsa, corn, extra cheese and lettuce.....UMMMMMMMM!!!!!
124149619252_10152343053104253:Praise Jesus he is risen! I work at H-E-B and we are also closed Easter Sunday . Chipotle is doing a great thing giving their employees off this holiday.  \=^.^=/
124149619252_10151024826814253:CHicken FAJITA burrito, white rice, chicken, cheese, sour cream, mild sauce, lettuce, corn, and a few good drops of Tobasco sauce. :)
124149619252_221129944611968:I want Chipolte so bad. Why is there not a CHipolte in Central Oregon, like Bend? I think it would get such good business out here, especially from me!
124149619252_10153071208839253:Hey how do I win this gift card, I love promoting your #chipotleproduct virally and am very important in my community and handsome.
124149619252_10152250518069253:I do wonder how much food was abandoned at the register because folks got through the entire process only to realize their fake coupon was no good.
124149619252_10151626575004253:I'm Mexican an that as about as legit as you can get for some burrito rolling. Especially for a white girl
124149619252_10153844182544253:Get those employees washing hands! I once saw an employee of yours eat pizza off the ground Chipotle Mexican Grill, so go figure....
124149619252_10151024826814253:3 hard shell steak tacos, lettuce, black beans, rice, cheese, and sour cream. A bag of chips with mild salsa and guacamole on the side! I love Chipotle's fresh natural ingredients! YUM!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito Bowl. White Rice, Black Beans, Chicken, Hot Sauce, Sour Cream, Guacamole, Cheese (Extra Cheese), and Lettuce :) BANG !!
124149619252_10153624802079253:The infamous line killer. " can I get tacos to go" . Only tortillas one workers will understand ... Lol
124149619252_10153246130479253:Lol at all the people who think that they can taste the difference now. That's now it how it works. The science is not strong in this thread
124149619252_10152407734029253:Not one cent of mine goes to any business that wants to bar me from it.  Yes, you bar my fire arm you're baring me.  Yes, it's personal.
124149619252_10152883478794253:You lost two real big customers to all of your Long Island and Nyc locations after your sorry excuse of a response was released ...  Will spread to all of my friends and family as well
124149619252_10153009001449253:Pass. I'll take real Mexican food, thank you very much.  Some Asada, with avocado lime suace, with hand made corn tortillas.  Now frick off outta my news feed!
124149619252_162705813797304:Grayson I work at chipotle and they have thought about it idk if they will though they are also thinking about a soup
124149619252_10153246130479253:Get smart and get  the true science on GMOs. Chipotle's goal brings nothing to the table when you can see the bigger picture.
124149619252_10151520750889253:I used to be a fan... but last time my family ate at the one in Gresham Oregon, we found a beatle in the salad. a big beatle with its head bit off.  YUK! and the assistant manager, offered me  my money back.   and insisted thay had washed the lettuce.  Missed one big green beatle!
124149619252_130482563683418:and I would love if you had queso like Qdoba so I dont need to waste my time with them.  There food isnt as good but oh that queso is a temptation.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito, extra rice, no beans, medium salsa, hot salsa, extra sour cream and cheese. Chips with guac.
124149619252_10153246130479253:http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/150422-genetically-modified-food-agriculture-health-ngbooktalk/
124149619252_202478973111117:No, that's the whole purpose: good quality, great tasting food for "Unlimited time only" meaning FOREVER!!! (Kind of making fun of companies that really do limited time offers) =)
124149619252_10152824057654253:I applaud Steve and leading Americans to eat healthier and encourage good farmers to simply do what is right for humanity without $$$ standing in your way, but is pork really good for Americans or soy tofu?
124149619252_10151687038594253:i would give my burritos to homless people when I did not need it for myself. There are so many here in san jose.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Lynn and I had heard about this... We definitely support non-GMO.  I feel we all have the right to know what is in our food and there is nothing legal in this country that makes it where it has to be labeled.  Whether you agree or not/care or not ... dont you want to know what is in your food? or anything else for that matter?  It is difficult to know though.  Many other countries have banned GMOs and are not buying the food grown in the US because we have nothing that supports even the labeling.  Its a crazy situation.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak bowl with a shell in the bottom, white rice, pinto beans, small amount of mild, lots and lots of sour cream, lots of cheese, and lettuce. Pure heaven. sometimes change it up with brown rice and black beans.
124149619252_10153357673124253:I ate my last chipotle burrito 3 years ago, please chipotle open a store near mc allen or brownsville tx!
124149619252_10153009001449253:I'm in the same boat as a lot of people here apparently (which makes me happy and sad at the same time).  Went out of my way to take advantage of this promotion only to find out they ran out of Sofritas.  Still ordered because I really enjoy Chipotle but very disappointing.
124149619252_10152382144342741:I love you Chipotle. Would even give you my first born. But you have to do something about the food prep line. Love the food, hate the disorganized food assembly.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Wait. . . Does this mean that they're no longer going to be serving chicken, beef, avocado, rice, and the rest of the foods they serve since everything we consume is GE?
124149619252_109031815838831:Certainly if you have a Chipotle in your area be happy. I dont and the closest one is several hours away. That being said I have ate Chipotle in four different states. Each time was a fantasticly delicious eating experience!
124149619252_10153163816204253:The 2 dollar dollop, though my favorite part ; Is fairly accurate from ending all the way through the start.  If you haven't been there, it's time for you to go.  When Billings' opens up, there we will be, rain, sun, or snow.  And get the burrito, for its better than bowl.  But eat it while fresh, it's not so tasty when old.
124149619252_100780796665922:I LOVE LOVE LOVE Chipotle! I am officially addicted to their burrito bowls usually get it at least once every week
124149619252_10152935096524253:Wow it will be awesome to get at the actual restaurant that much inside the burrito I never get that much of anything and guacamole less
124149619252_196014333852317:Sweet!!! Looking forward to it -- I'm back in Chicago on Monday and that's the first place I'll be after I check in at the other office..
124149619252_10153246130479253:First bashing farmers, now showing lack of understanding food technology. Sounds like a great place to eat for urbanites with no understanding of what happens at farms who rely on fake "undercover" documentaries.
124149619252_10153009001449253:They could have at least put signs on the door saying they were out of sofrita.  Same as so many on here, went out of my way after getting home late to go support this promotion. And nowhere on the advertisement does it say "while supplies last". They should still honor the free one for next time if you asked for it and couldn't get it.
124149619252_156053474470:COLUMBUS? NOOO you're one city off, do that in Dayton!! Although then i'd probably be poor because i'd order every day. My laziness is saving my pocket atm..
124149619252_10151089035244253:I went to my favorite location in Powell Ohio the other day and they were out of all meats except chicken and didnt have black beans. For some reason that happens a lot. Had to find another place to eat. :(
124149619252_261338423981855:Thanks so much for the amazing, locally grown fresh tomatoes that were in my vege bowl today!  I am in Pittsburgh:)

124149619252_10152262999499253:Not for nothing but there needs to be a Chipotle in the upstate area namely Poughkeepsie NY there is one in Middletown but that's across the river.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Chipotle Mexican Grill, can we order the tofu on the side? I'm not trying to take advantage like some others and just throw the tofu out, however I'm not sure if I like it and wasting Chipotle is against my religion.
124149619252_100780796665922:Chipotle FTW.  Also, I do agree with the article that some of the options you can get from Chipotle basically scream obesity, but really it's still up to the customer to decide that.  I for one get a reasonable meal there every time (health wise) and I always leave satisfied :D.
124149619252_10153521011509253:Lucia Dutková omg, chcem chvem chcem najviac! taky vecer s vinkom, chipotle a sex v meste ????????????
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl with tortilla on the side, white rice, black beans, lettuce, tomato, extra corn, sour cream, cheese, medium salsa. P.s. Please put a chipotle in provo, utah!!
124149619252_10152406485254253:Never again.  I won't subject my family to be sitting ducks for next whacked out drug induced idiot looking for a kill streak.   Good bye Chipotle. 
124149619252_10151307314369253:Thank you for being closed and closing your stores early on Christmas Eve.  This is another reason why I support your business.  What would be even nicer if to still pay your employees for Christmas Day.
124149619252_10151251776579253:It is such a high level of like that my family calls it stalking even at times crazy. I call it normal obsession. Great company, food, dining experience, and amazing people..... What's not to like at a "crazy" level?
124149619252_10152406485254253:A few author suggestions from Chicana Role Model Michele Serros: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152450847327640&set=a.441371667639.227048.772647639&type=1
124149619252_10151192106409253:Hey all so I'm a gm at the Prescott chipotle....guac and double meat IS included in the $2 price!!! Everyone who shows up in somewhat of a costume is eligible!!!! We r all gonna be busy!!!
124149619252_10151587164929253:Oooooh, put soybeans in that, too.  Soybean oil that is GMO?  Very bad.  It's about your wholesaler.  Find one that sells organic soy oil, and you'll be fine.
124149619252_156053474470:I'd love to see this pilot in more cities. I know I'd order delivery chipotle extremely often! Great idea!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thank you. And thank you for listing the reasons clearly. There's a fine line between GMO paranoia and valid concern. As you say, it's about quality and environmental stewardship.
124149619252_10151185000424253:check out the great costume i bought i had to wear it for chipotles contest check it out and vote for me
124149619252_105860719543628:Great commercial and they way it should be to much crap goes into the foods we consume... Cheers for going back to the way everyone needs to be 
124149619252_10153872104594253:Shorter lines for the rest of us. For those of you who say "never Chipotle again" just remember  McDonalds in 1982 and 2002 and 07 Burger King in 1997 Kentucky Frieds coleslaw Sizzlers  Jack in the Box These are still at the top outbreaks.
124149619252_185864848093833:If you cared about animal rights most likely you would give them antibiotics if they were sick, it more inhumane to let them suffer.. But I guess that's the price people are willing to pay to say they eat "organically raised antibiotic free meat"
124149619252_10152453918534253:My favorite job ever!! I love working for this company!! Hope to have my store within the next year ????
124149619252_10152883504929253:GMO free and proud of you for your efforts, forget those other mexican resturants im going to Chipolte only !   Thank you!
124149619252_131676086962937:Me and my fiance have been there at least 6 times together since March and checked in and I got the badge and he didn't. He still doesn't have the badge. Can you guys fix it? :(
124149619252_10153357673124253:Oh man... I miss Chipotle! I live in NW Wyoming and we don't have one anywhere close to us. We just have crappy ole Taco John's. :(
124149619252_10152805746454253:White rice, Black beans, Barbacoa, Green peppers and onions, Lettuce, Cheese, Sour cream, Hottest sauce you got!, and sometimes corn, it depends.
124149619252_10153246130479253:I support your open willingness to exploit uninformed emotions and take those people dumb enough to fall for your marketing gimmick to the cleaners. This is the kind of true evil and dishonesty that Monsanto,syngenta,Dow,DuPont, Bayer, and others can only dream of.
124149619252_10151486609219253:Veggie fajita burrito, brown rice, black beans, everything but corn with guac on the side for chips :3
124149619252_10151024826814253:Same thing everytime - Crunchy Steak tacos fully loaded with a bag of chips, tomato salsa and guac with a tea. Heaven.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Science doesn't matter, all that matters is what Vani Hari shouts about. You know she's an expert and understands what she's talking about. Another alarmist win.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I tried them on Saturday January 17th and they tasted lousy then. I'm guessing they haven't gotten better.
124149619252_10151999836584253:I love the Lake Street location.  Online ordering for my meeting a month ago was so fast and easy, was like having a magical burrito producing unicorn at my beck and call.
124149619252_10151486609219253:2 scoops of white rice, fajitas , black beans , half chicken half steak corn cheese lettuce . All the hot sauces. Extra tortilla >:) guac on le side
124149619252_10151185000424253:Jackson We donate all year long to our foundation. Our Boorito fundraiser is just one of many things that we do. - Joe
124149619252_10152949800154253:I am a frequent customer of Chipolte and if something is not done about this and made public you just lost my business and im sure im not the only one. Absolutely disgusting!  https://www.facebook.com/SurviveTheStreet/photos/a.445175095575113.1073741828.444676708958285/757782017647751/?type=1&theater
124149619252_156053474470:you dont really have to deliver cuz it's not that difficult to go to the location~ but drive thru would be SOOO helpful! :D

124149619252_10153246130479253:Holy cow, someone one on this page thinks GMO uses less chemicals then organic. First off organic food isn't sprayed with chemicals. Wow
124149619252_213189592025031:will you be recycling there? and does The Nature Conservancy know you don't recycle at all your locations...?
124149619252_10152786808474253:Chicken burrito for me with brown rice, corn salsa sour cream and extra cheese with a side of dressing and chips and green salsa. I don't care for the steak because it has to much fat on it.
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken fajita with tortilla chips & guacamole on the side !!! *this is so cruel, making your fan hungry - and you're not here in Indonesia!!
124149619252_10152538683134253:Easy recipe to remember. Could make it at home since I make it at work lol. It may be $2 but everyone loves that guac
124149619252_10151086390274253:you have a location in LONDON and not in Covington, Louisiana ?!?! You are killing me! - signed "loyal fan in covington, louisiana...."
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito... White rice, black beans, chicken, everything except corn. Yes, guacamole too! :) Chipotle's makes me so happy (:
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito Bowl: brown rice, 2 scoops black beans, fajitas, steak, medium salsa, 2 scoops corn salsa, cheese, and lettuce w/a vinaigrette dressing. So yummy!
124149619252_10152004082504253:....it means nothing, its mostly pseudo Latin,  even though some of the words are real, none of the endings make sense, nor a coherent sentence
124149619252_10152453918534253:Does chipotle know that the majority of people that get that free water cup fill it up with soda? I am sure everyone appreciates that freebie?
124149619252_10151520750889253:And what's the reason you're closed Easter exactly? It's a holiday for kids to eat chocolate and hard boiled eggs.
124149619252_10153050146164253:Speaking of TED check out this great video! Awareness is the first step to a solution. Please help me spread the word. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=o0VrZPBskpg
124149619252_10151258924194253:As a chipotle employee it's nice to be able to spend time with my family :) thanks for all the support guys, we love all our awesome customers! Happy Thanksgiving to you all!
124149619252_10153009001449253:are people really still acting like a 5 year old over tofu? Get over it. I'm not a huge tofu fan, but this is really good.
124149619252_10152676820799253:We need one of these in Cumming, GA.  A version that offers non-GMO, organic ingredients, along with a delicious gluten-free crust option.  :)  I'd be first in line!
124149619252_181086415246015:Ed, sending food to starving people keeps them in that situation. You know the saying give a man a fish feed him for a day, but teach a man to fish.... I think chipotle is doing just fine by focusing on the local.
124149619252_205082546217004:Joe I see you run the facebook page 2 lol oooh an you guys leave Mc Donald's out if it you gotta star somewhere 
124149619252_10152250518069253:I can't believe people think they should honor this. If they did that, think the problems it would cause. I'm sure I could draw up an "I get free burritos for life" poster. Should they honor that too??
124149619252_267832333301923:I almost went for that until I saw the $18 price tag then $7 for shipping.  I'm cool with the idea of recycling and having something that was a piece of Chipotle so to speak.  Price is just a tad bit high.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Went to your Union center west Chester Ohio store and decided to utilize the online ordering app. My order took almost 45 minutes to make (two burritos), leaked through the bag And stained my car seat, and once home I found out the one order was wrong. My husband and I were very disappointed with the service and even though we enjoyed the softitas will not return to that location.
124149619252_10153246130479253:It's a free market, they are allowed to do what they want. If they want to spend more on materials and sell their food at a higher price, fine by me.
124149619252_130482563683418:Jill - bummer! It sucks when you really like something and you have to go out of your way to get it, keep trying with the Corp office and I hope they work it out over there; and not to compare apples to oranges but my local Chipotle doesn't serve margaritas, so I have to drive to Berkeley if I want one with my tacos!
124149619252_10151089035244253:While I love my local Chipotle in Stillwater, OK, my favorite will always be the Manhattan, KS location in Aggieville.
124149619252_213189592025031:Come to my city (Harrisburg PA) and give me a free buritto and I'll kick a tree and give it a band-aid
124149619252_10151185000424253:I work at chipotle and its going to bee crazyyyyyyyyyyyy but its cool we could do itttttttttt ,and ya its 2$ and its what ever you's want on it it will bee Borritos , tacos ,bowls, so go in to any chipotlezzzzz and get your food , and it dont matter how YOU'S dress ;)))))))))) have fun everyone ;)
124149619252_10153830182809253:When you do your training at your Folsom, CA store, make sure to tell the employees not to serve the food like slop at a farm. That's why I quit going even before this food bacteria outbreak
124149619252_454413931302356:Donna--please go to the BSOA website, scouting.org. The word "Christian" does not appear. Or else they're ashamed of it.
124149619252_10151719407409253:Day 5 (The FWI Freeway):  1. Usually when you roll something this good, it's illegal.  2. The Happy Pill. Now in a 567,000 mg dose.  3. Open wide, no wider.  4. The gourmet restaurant where you eat with your hands.  5. They beep when they backup.
124149619252_10153257383459253:Umm, can they get some rubber boots? I know I like mine. If the are turning over ground by hand like I did it would be useful..
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken salad, black beans, brown rice, cheese and plain corn (the locations that have it)  I wish the guar didn't have onions in it and the portions were more consistent.. other than that I LOVE THIS PLACE!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl: white rice, veggies, barbacoa, tomatoes, guacamole, lettuce, and cheese. And a clementine Izzy. beautiful

124149619252_10152883504929253:"Thank You For Vegan Burritos. Thank You For Pushing Them... One Thing Though, To Add Like A Tiny Scoop Of Guacamole, Is $2.50!! That's Almost A Quarter The Price Of The Whole Burrito. Charge A Dollar For Extras, Like Everyone Else... Anyway, Thank You Very Much, For Taking Pork Off The Menu, And Having Vegan Options." =GZ
124149619252_10152935096524253:Mike Liebig, we are very sorry this happened and we respect the tough job our police men and women do everyday. Perhaps this help explain what happened a little better: http://chip.tl/NYPDStatement -Skyllo
124149619252_10153246130479253:GMO's need to be banned all together so they do not contaminate organic crops. The biotech industry is the next tobacco industry, they know their products cause cancer and are hiding it from the public.
124149619252_182078509223:not a vegan, but a vegetarian, and i have to say that it's about time that those who choose not to eat meat have a protein option at chipotle besides the black beans. moe's has tofu, so it always confused me why chipotle didn't do something like that. aaaaand i just so happen to live in northern virginia so a trip to dc would take me about fifteen minutes. i know what i'm doing for thanksgiving
124149619252_10152250518069253:No such thing as a free burrito? Are you saying I've imagined all those FREE BURRITO coupons from California Tortilla?
124149619252_10153066985824253:I'm eating my left-over Sofritas bowl for breakfast while I read this  :)  It was also a FREE meal thanks to the promo last month.  Thanks for the vegan option!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Burrito with white rice, fajitas, mild and medium salsa, lettuce, sour cream, and, of course, cheese. BTW, just looking at that picture makes my mouth water...
124149619252_156053474470:do you deliver to Japan? I've been trying to figure that out for months.. my pregnant wife is desperately craving chipotle, and there aren't any here...
124149619252_10150260445594253:Need one in bluffton sc or savannah ga.  Better than 4 hr drive to charlotte nc to get my barbacoa fix.
124149619252_10150959152619253:This is such a nice shot! I'm going to make sure it's the 1st and last place I visit next time I travel to and from Dulles Airport http://youtu.be/Hike0sSn7dw
124149619252_10153903490999253:Thanks for the free Chipotle text giveaway you initiated a few weeks ago, however I am very hesitant to use it. Both my roommate and friend used theirs last week at 2 seperate Baltimore locations and both became ill several hours later. It appears that the additional safety measures you implemented are not fully bring utilized or flawed. Hopefully Chipotle will eventually get it right.
124149619252_10153340431804253:Perfectly OK with VT being back in the twenties on this list. It's only across main street and we still have the #1 campus food in the country! Go Hokies!
124149619252_10153602183249253:Who is against the labeling of Gmos? Hmmm I wonder? Not a huge mystery here folks that this is the work of Monsanto. Nice try, evil monsantan!

124149619252_10150267993759253:Tony, unfortunately Garden Blend just didn't sell well. We tried expanding the test, but we had to cut it back. We'll keep working on other possible vegan alternatives for the future though, and we appreciate your interest. - Joe
124149619252_10152927494854253:I don't care what an individual does at a company. I will eat it as long as it tastes good and the customer service is good.

124149619252_10153246130479253:On one hand I respect a corporation's decisions regarding marketing. I also respect people's right to eat whatever they choose.   But please do not join the anti science bandwagon.  I ?? your food too much ! Eat chipotle at least once or twice a week

124149619252_244957752262179:Chipotle Truck?  What a great idea.  Will we be seeing these spring up at festivals around the country?

124149619252_10152250518069253:You all should honor it! Its giving the company great social buzz and was going to repost & follow but now I'm not. Disappointed.
124149619252_10153009001449253:My location ran out also (Cunnigham drive cincinnati oh ). Perhaps your marketing was too good this time?
124149619252_10152693491999253:Whatever... During the 70's, 80's and 90's we all grew up eating products with sugar and whatever tastes good! We alright today !!!!
124149619252_10152407734029253:I see cops eating at chipotle all the time. I guess they can't eat there either, or will chipotle be hypocritical and let the police eat there?
124149619252_164816057005566:Want!  So happy you are expanding veggie options.  I will be anxiously waiting for the nationwide release.
124149619252_10151024826814253:bowl with rice and black beans, chicken and steak, mild and medium AND corn salsa, with cheese and guac. MMMM!!! :-)
124149619252_10152250518069253:When I lived in Colorado Springs ('01-'03) near a Chipotle, they did free burrito day once a year... does that not happen anymore? :(
124149619252_10153569576059253:I was thinking of trying here today so I got to know one question is you using real meat like real chicken and beef and no other stuff we'll eventually hear on the news like a certain restaurant? I have to know.
124149619252_10153246130479253:What a travesty. Non-Gmo is simply irresponsible. There is no evidence of any danger from gmo, and we CAN NOT feed the world without it.
124149619252_10153246130479253:I don't mind being overweight with heart disease, as long as I know dirty scientists haven't contaminated my food with their anti God conspiracy altered alien foods!!!

124149619252_10153246130479253:Bravo.  Chipotle will now be the only fast food chain I'll even consider popping into in a food pinch.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito bowl, brown rice, black beans, fajitas, mild and medium salsa, corn, whipped cream, cheese, and lettuce... Oh yeah an 3 dog taco tortillas on the side. Put a crap ton of Tabasco chipotle flavor on and shake= godly
124149619252_215673425111837:I love Chipotle!  The only thing that could make Chipotle BETTER is adding a queso sauce to the menu.  (Ours doesn't have it anyway.)  Keep up the good work and yummy food!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Cheriss Helen Nunez I saw you repost the free meal thing and was going to do it but then saw this on their page. Sorry to disappoint. :(
124149619252_10151089035244253:Garden City, NY. Great staff and the food is almost always consistently equal portioned and good. Other locations I've been to were not as enjoyable and sometimes even disappointed. Hicksville, NY is also a good one.

124149619252_10151149854739253:are there free burritos for "testing", AKA eating, after the demonstration. can't let that food go to waste!
124149619252_10152805746454253:Double brown rice, Double pinto beans, Double chicken and mild/medium, sour cream cheese....Bomb ????????
124149619252_10152236327209253:Chipotle just got added to my BANNED list for saying they might stop serving Guacamole because of global warming! That is the stupidest excuse I have heard in a long long time. So long Chipotle.
124149619252_10151089035244253:I love Chipotle's food. I'm a shareholder. But every restaurant I go into is LOUD and COLD!!!  I take out religiously. 
124149619252_105860719543628:I love your food...more than what could be considered healthy but...how green can you claim to be when it used to be more than efficient to write our names on the foil but now it requires paper sticky name tags on every item...hmmm
124149619252_10151089035244253:My favorite location is Sandusky, Ohio. They provided my family a meal while we were in the hospital for my son's chemo treatments. Thanks so much everyone at Sandusky Chipotle!!
124149619252_100780796665922:Chipotle is a freaking religion! I've never heard of anyone going to Qdoba, he have one down the street from a chipotle and it's always empty :3
124149619252_10150602702709253:Thank you Chipotle for the chance to win free burritos.... Pretty awesome of you guys!!!!!! We will be hitting the Dallas/Mckinney area this weekend and Chipotle will be a pit stop for sure :-)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl, brown rice,black beans, pork,mild salsa onions and peppers, little sour cream, cheese lettuce and Guacamole of course. :)
124149619252_10153351140389253:Way too go! Heard about McDonald's failing because of Chipotle! I LOVE YOU! McDonalds is my worst enemy and I feel my hate for the company McDonald's deep in my soul. I am so glad for you and I hope you slay every McDonald's restaurant in America. Keep up the good work! I am in standing in salute to you. Go you! (No this isn't sarcastic I'm serious)
124149619252_10153806089609253:We who want non gmo, delicious food still support you Chipotle! Thank you for facing corporate giants who are trying to take you down!
124149619252_10153389325099253:I'm not eating Chipotle now.  :(   When I do, I'm privileged to say I can walk to the local establishment in Findlay OH.  :)
124149619252_10152250518069253:Well, I deserve a free burrito bowl at a minimum because every time I frequent your Naples Mercato location I have to clean my own table. The staff there does a miserable job at keeping the tables & flooring sanitary. There will be 5 people helping the food line & no one working the floor cleaning & attending the beverage station. On the off chance tables are being wiped, it is with a filthy rag.
124149619252_10151089035244253:I like that the Chipotle in Chinatown in DC says Mexican Grill in Mandarin. The best tasting chipotle I've ever had was in Richmond, VA.
124149619252_454413931302356:You can count on me and my family of 5 as well as everyone I know on not doing business with you. If only your company had traditional family values we might have something in common.
124149619252_209217239092800:and @ our store it is...  Busy Busy Busy, so it will be fun to watch and see if the contestants can prep for the lunch rush...
124149619252_10153034270734253:The last time I ate at Taco Bell I became violently ill afterwards. So why did I eat there in the first place? In all fairness it was tasty at first and it was cheap. But I just can't do it again. Never have that problem at Chipotle. Learn from my mistakes, people.
124149619252_10152632602189253:Ok, besides the sky diving one, I don't find anything over the top about what these other people have done...Oh God, I think I have a problem:)
124149619252_10153150981964253:Too bad your La Plata, MD location can't see it as easy. Horrible customer service. Got all three orders wrong. Had to drive back, was made to wait in line again and was offered a buy one get one. Is this the twilight zone? Rude and bad service doesn't cover it. Your store manager Eduardo needs to be seriously evaluated. Don't worry we will spread the word how bad this location is.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Thought it was fake a billion dollar company giving a burato away to real to be true I like quadva anyway
124149619252_10152262999499253:My soul is like a tofu ready to eat in water. But everyday it seems like its a struggle and pain just to be a vegetaryan its the only true master race!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito bowl with white rice, pinto beans, tomato salsa, a little bit of green salsa, cheese, and lettuce, maybe guacamole if I feel extra special :D
124149619252_10153009001449253:Tried the sofritas today.  Good thing it's "free." I'm open minded but there just wasnt any flavor and the sofritas mixture was runny,  making my burrito fall apart.  Back to chicken.
124149619252_10153246130479253:A step in the right direction.  The next step is to remove the drinks that have gmo's.  You still get gmo's from the sodas they serve.  Either way Chipotle is the best and continues to try and improve the quality of the food they serve.
124149619252_10152883478794253:After what I read about in your store in New York I'll not be setting foot in any of your stores. Alas word of mouth travels far and I have a big mouth. I'll be watching to see how you (Chipotle) handles this.
124149619252_10151024826814253:jalapeno burger-ground beef to make patties chop up some fresh jalapenos (or cayenne pepper) then cook
124149619252_10153246130479253:I will be bringing my family here regularly now, never been before but I have a feeling I will love it from now in!
124149619252_205455487672:So what would it take for Chipotle to be one of the food chains that is available on the military bases?  Because we are going through some major Chipotle withdrawls here in Germany!!
124149619252_10152250518069253:What's so funny ,is you tag yourself to there Fb page.But,Joe says its not real its a hoax...sounds like to me they plan the hoax....Attention Joe!,! If you want your sales to go up,give free burritos... not,everyone has try them ...just something to think.....
124149619252_167132760066216:We took a voyage..........to Denver we flew with praise......to pay our hommage         (true story!  family vacation in August 2011 centered around going to original Chipotle!)
124149619252_10152323527922741:Farming ain't what it used to be. And I think we can thank mega-farmers in part for the cancer scourge.
124149619252_10151024826814253:bowl..with lime cilantro rice, fajitas, no beans, steak, mild tomato salsa, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and guacamole on the side....omg...I love  Chipotle !!!
124149619252_10152406485254253:I'd rather go without food then eat with guns around in a family establishment--no appetite for this at all. Shame on Chipotle and your encouragement towards war zones. Very sickening--
124149619252_10152262999499253:Thank you for the sofritas!! Very tasty. Just try to keep the dead animals from falling into the sofritas bin. I walked out when I saw the same spoon being used for the meat AND the tofu.
124149619252_10152949800154253:It wasn't the company but an employee, it's up to chipotle to handle it appropriately you can't be expected to be responsible for all your employees actions, but how you respond is important
124149619252_454413931302356:Donna-- BSOA is NOT a Christian organization. They accept Jewish children, Muslim children, and children with no religion. My son never encountered any Christian theology when he was in the Scouts about 10 years ago. In fact, the originator of the Scouting movement was gay.
124149619252_10153543212484253:MN one sucked and ran out of supplies at 5 when it was supposed to go to 7. Lines for food took forever. They also pass along improper information on GMO.
124149619252_10152990683604253:I cannot wait until I'm over this illness so I can eat Chipotle again ?? its my all time favorite food
124149619252_160584150738666:Andrew Checca and Kyle Ripp are currently traveling together in Paris! I'll make sure they stop by and partake in this landmark event!!!!!
124149619252_10153693560944253:Shut it down, evaluate the incident, assess procedures, revise your game plan and reintegrate when ready. #iLoveChip #iLoveChipotle #iWantChipotle ???? #noChipotleInJapan
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa Burrito Bowl w/ White Rice, Black Beans, Cheese, Lettuce, Sour Cream, Corn, Mild Salsa and sometimes Guac either in the Burrito Bowl or along with the Chips. Gets me every time! Haha
124149619252_157777224183:Stick to serving food and the jacka$$ in Washington D.C. worry about solar power! Don't forget you'll have to turn the real power on once the sun goes down at night! Plus don't you'll use gas to cook with on the grills?  Mmm!!! How is solar power going to supply gas to those grills?  Well keep up the work on the food love it!
124149619252_10153246130479253:So, you use non-GMO rennet which would be animal based? Unless I've misheard (which is possible) it's one or another.
124149619252_10152693491999253:I love how when I "Liked" this comment "related" pages such as Panera Bread and Chick-fil-A came up.  Yeah, they are just what I want to check out when I am a supporter of FED UP.
124149619252_156053474470:Bring Chipotle to Ithaca, New York please.... we just got five guys and we need chipotle so much.  cornell and ithaca college are here and so many people here love chipotle please do it.
124149619252_10153830182809253:Its alot better then tacobell and you wanna call this place fake mexican food maybe you go to taco bell chipotle puts tacobell too shame

124149619252_10151024826814253:Double Meat Fajita! Hot sauce and roasted chilli corn! Add cheese, guac and sour cream! AND YES PLEASE! YUMMY!
124149619252_10152949800154253:If you guys read the press release you would know that they don't condone this kind of behavior. I know many cops at my local Chipotle have never been disrespected or mistreated. Does one action of a citizen make up all of America's actions? No? If you think it does than I guess we're all terrorists. Yup. There ya go now go foam at the mouth somewhere else.
124149619252_10153135670549253:Just moved back home from being in Colorado Springs for a few years at Fort Carson. PLEASE come to Chattanooga, Tn. I have gone my whole pregnancy so far without Chipotle and it's KILLING me!!! It's all I want! Chattanooga would LOVE this!
124149619252_105860719543628:Amazing! I've been a loyal Chipotle fan for 10 years and they continue to reinforce my loyalty and love for their company, their products and philosophy! Great job Joe & all at Chipotle!!! I'll be watching for the spot Sunday night!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Carnitas pork, rice, sour cream, pico de gallo, corn, lettuce, cheese green chipotle pinto beans in a bowl
124149619252_10153020304519253:Joe, you are totally awesome! I have been a fan of Chipotle for so many years, & after years on not giving up on getting a job there, I finally got hired! I remember when I first loved Chipotle & I started commenting on your posts & you were always so friendly with your replies! You are definitely apart of the reason Chipotle is so awesome! I cannot wait to start training! :D
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito, add rice, sour cream, and if you'd like, more possible additions are lettuce, pico, and cheese.
124149619252_10153489055424253:Of course, some of us don't need that shirt because we know that guacamole is included at no extra charge when you order a veggie item...and know to mention that it's a veggie to the person at the end of the line when you ask for it on the side. ;)
124149619252_10153009001449253:I went in yesterday and I was checking out and I asked the guy if he has tried the tofu he said no I how come you work here his reply I eat meat lol.....I walked away on a good note
124149619252_10151024826814253:Hi. Can i get a burrito bowl please. Brown Rice, chicken, hot sauce, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce!
124149619252_10153246130479253:But you still serve meat that was raised on GMO feed and sodas which are all made with genetically modified HFCS. A step in the right direction, for sure, but I'm saddened by the false advertising :(
124149619252_185864848093833:People also need to realize that fish are being farmed now too...so don't assume avoiding "meat" saves you from this problem
124149619252_10153395310879253:Not another one !! Sad to say no more Chipotle for me , just when you werr moving in a great direction of #NonGmo.
124149619252_10153088156639253:Kazia Thao Shong Moua Mel Phom Dee NguyenPa Kathy TaoSheng KaLang Vang pleasssssse. Chipotle's my life!
124149619252_10152004082504253:The lorem ipsum text is typically a mangled section of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC Latin text by Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed that make it nonsensical and not proper Latin.

124149619252_10152250518069253:wouldn't it be nice for a free burrito once in a while though?   or maybe some discounts would be nice haha.
124149619252_156053474470:I SERIOUSLY just sat here and thought "I wish Chipotle Delivered" now, we're now going to Chipotle. Delivery is a fantastic idea! Bring it here!
124149619252_10153246130479253:GMOs have made nobody sick, but do allow low-income people to afford fresh produce. Obesity is endemic and kills millions of people. You chose to remove the GMOs and not shrink the size of the burrito?
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thanks for doing what is right and looking out for the consumer, Chipotle. The other side continues to distort the truth and make false claims of safety. We appreciate you, Chipotle, for putting safety first!
124149619252_10151024826814253:hard shell carnitas tacos, white rice, hot & corn salsa, sour cream, lettuce, cheese, and top it all off with a couple of splashes of both tabasco sauces. Oh..and gotta have a coke with some lemons squeezed in it.

124149619252_10153576894879253:Is there a reason why my chipotle burritos are going up in price and down in size? The servers are seriously skimping these days
124149619252_10152250518069253:cheap people whining because a fake offer won't be honored. it's a place of business that offers food. If you want it, buy it. Otherwise get over it.
124149619252_10152810389849253:The lady in the background! haha  My family and I just got back from trick or treating and a Boorito run. Good times.
124149619252_240071849428248:if i were to win free burritos for a year from Chipotle, i would die truly the happiest person to ever walk this planet.
124149619252_10152812285609253:Chipotle needs to get a contract with the U.S. Army and install a restaurant at every PX on every Army base world-wide. The options Soldiers currently have at every PX? Pizza Hut, Burger King, Manchu Wok (crappy Chinese food), Subway, Charley's Subs, Baskin Robbins, usually a smoothie/juice bar, and now Starbucks.   1. Do you know how HAPPY Soldiers would be, to have a truely *healthy option?! We Love Chipotle!  2. Do you have any idea how much money Chipotle would make? I can't even fathom how much. So that's how much.. an unfathomable amount of money, if Soldiers had fast, direct access to Chipotle on every Army base.   People would cry, if this happened. People would fall to their knees, look up to their god(s), thank them, and cry with joy.   Get on that, Chipotle. Contract with the Army. Thanks in advance! :-D
124149619252_10153009001449253:Sofritas brought me back to Chipotle!  I have to admit I was lured away by a competitor with more vegetarian options. Now, its all about sofritas.
124149619252_109031815838831:All you whiners complaining you've never gotten a free meal.   Give me a break. The foods great and the people are to! I go to the one by my work so much the know what we want before I order it. To the chipotle in mentor Ohio, the guys from Pako thank you!!!!!
124149619252_10152250518069253:I was all WOOOOOOO!!!! Then I had to check so I didn't look like an idiot at the register lol!!! Pammy
124149619252_10153246130479253:Courtney Speed this is why you need to come back to Chipotle, they actually care about more than dollars & cents
124149619252_10153009001449253:Easy getting sofritas, no wait in Fayettevile AR. While  Flavor good, salt levels gave me a 3-hour headache. More than 1/2 RDA, please consider total health.
124149619252_10151258924194253:Chipotle Mexican Grill should be categorized as 'Essential Services' and that way these holidays can  be abolished. We miss you on Thanksgiving day.  Just kidding. Happy Holiday folks!
124149619252_10153246130479253:I always thought of Chipotle as a rare treat because it was pricey. Now it will e much more rare. Gonna be even more expensive.
124149619252_160584150738666:One of these days maybe you can roll a burrito in Montana! We are all craving a chipotle burrito up here!!!!
124149619252_10152262999499253:I tired it and it wasn't that bad!!!....i love chipotle!!!!....the workers know exactly what i like!!

124149619252_10152824057654253:I hope he was eaten by the pig on his quest. Niman Ranch and Chipotle are murderers! Stop lying to people.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Everyone is complaining that they never got to try the sofritas...didn't you get a free burrito even though they were out? I didn't get to try it either, but they honored the promotion for next time.
124149619252_10150942028479253:Medium green, preferable the old green that you had like 3 years ago, it was much better. More flavor, less smokey.
124149619252_100780796665922:And lo, their souls did hunger and their lips did thirst,for no amount of Qdoba could satisfy their yearnings. In so much that they did cry up unto the lord and begged unto him to feed their bellies. And behold, our God was a merciful God and did show unto them the way the truth and the light: Chipotle. The people rejoyced and offered up unto Him prayers of gratitude and love. The gift of the Lord was such that they could walk and not be weary, they could run and not feel faint. And the Lord did smile upon them and did say unto them, "My beloved ones, go unto Qdoba no more for he that seeketh out the abode of the devil will suffer such consequences that there will be no parallel. Yay, in so much that a day will come when the righteous will bathe in the blood of the Qdoba frequenters." And so passed the first age of the People of Chipotle

124149619252_10153543212484253:We had a great time!! Andrew Zimmern was great , food was delish, and I'm now in line at Chipotle in Rochester to get my free menu items ! Donna Tello
124149619252_10151892810414253:I want to know how Steven Tyler from Aerosmith got a personlized card and free burritos for a year and wasn't on the winners list.   ?? :-)
124149619252_10150942028479253:Hot is Chipotle's most flavorful.  Just make sure the server pours it across the burrito, rather than in one spot.  I also normally have corn and pico with it (so, hot, medium, and mild).
124149619252_10151058843154253:Muy avanzados en todo pero las gerentes tratan a los empleados como animales , tienen ma integridad los animales que los emplelados Chipotle de \vienna VA, lastima . Integridad??? qiuiza el dueno ni cuenta se de.

124149619252_10151024826814253:Chipotle is perfect any way I order it.  Honestly its the one restaurant I've never had a bad experience at.
124149619252_10152786808474253:Wait, a margarita?!?!?!?!? My local Chipotle doesn't have those!  And extra cilantro? Didn't know you could ask for that. It's not along the ordering line that I go through.
124149619252_10153302468484253:Today is a perfect day for the patio!  I can almost always think of ways to improve a restaurant, but now that Chipotle got rid of the last GMO, and added brown rice, there is nothing to improve! Every Chipotle meal is better than the last!
124149619252_10153262094399253:Add more lime juice and place the pit in the finished guac, this will keep it from going bad/dark color.
124149619252_10153555173409253:We Love Chipole Grill,,, but its sooooo far away from us. Please consider opening one in our area..... Olean NY.

124149619252_10153555173409253:We need one in down town Charleston SC. We travel over 15 miles in the weekend just to eat a Chipotle burrito. We are that loyal and addicted. Would go almost everyday if you guys come closer. :)
124149619252_10152250518069253:Do people not realize if companies honored these hoaxes every time some fool created one, they'd lose tons of profits and the number of hoaxes floating around to fool us would increase? You know what would happen then to make up for all the loss? Prices would be driven up for the rest of us. An $8 burrito would become a $10, then $12... Expecting Chipotle to honor a hoax every time someone--who clearly has too much time on their hands--creates one is ridiculous.
124149619252_10152715839394253:Some chipotle workers need to stop being so stingy and give me more than a spoonful of rice, 5 beans, 8 pieces of chicken, one kernel of corn, a dallop of sour cream and 6 strands of cheese. LITERALLY!!!!
124149619252_10151587164929253:Some of the farms are in the USA, but 100% of the materials we sell are made in the USA. And you can read more about Loomstate's practices here: http://www.loomstate.org/about- Joe

124149619252_10151258924194253:Thank you for being closed! I hope all your employees have an amazing Thanksgiving. Another reason why I love Chipotle.
124149619252_10153693560944253:Number of E. coli cases at Chipotle from 1993-2015: 0  Number of E. coli cases at Chipotle since going non-GMO only 7 months ago: 78.  No change in suppliers, no change in food-hnadling protocols - only a very public campaign against GMO's and factory farmed animals.  NOT A coincidence. Corporate sabotage. #Monsanto?
124149619252_10152250518069253:Well for sure this HOAX it's getting some real attention for your company... I love chipotle's so... yeah, I am not sorry about reposting
124149619252_192398874125268:Could you offer the corn and tomato salsa without the little green chilies chopped up in them. PLEASE!!! I love your food but those burn my mouth/stomach up and then I can't eat :(
124149619252_10153555173409253:Add Shrimp or fish to the menu please?! I pay the same price for a burrito without meat! What's up with that! Lol.
124149619252_10151626575004253:We would like to have your restaurant come to Bucksport, Maine.  Then you could make them for us!  You already have customers waiting.  Check us out.  We are the best waterfront town on the mid coast.  Your loyal customers could even get to your place by boat!

124149619252_10153135670549253:Went in Friday night waited 20 minutes in line. They only had three people working the line..SMH. When I get up to order, I order A carnitas burrito with a side of extra carnitas it is at that moment that I and my family are told, "we are out of carnitas and don't know when we will get more." WHAT!?! I ask why a sign if some sort is not posted response i got was "I don't know." Very bad customer service.  At least posting a note I would have not waited the 20 minutes in line because I know my kids ONLY like and will only eat the Carnitas. I wasted money on two chicken burritos my kids hardly touched( about 4 bites) and a side of chicken my toddler did not touch at all.  Not a satisfied customer at all! What is going on Chipotle customer service used to be so much better?
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken fajita bowl w/white rice, no beans, peppers & onions, hot, sour cream, cheese, guacamole, and lettuce.  Plus squeeze on some lime. 
124149619252_10152250518069253:I came here looking to see if it was fake, since I doubt a large company like Chipotle would distribute a coupon in such a unofficial manner.
124149619252_10152883478794253:I filled the whole thing out with No beans added and I get some dunbass "Beanium" name. So stupid. What a waste of time.
124149619252_178542422170361:finally got one close to me and it has been So busy I cannot even attempt to go there yet..can't wait

124149619252_156053474470:o yeah and start delivering to southern california, we got plenty of expendable incomes and lazy people
124149619252_10152453918534253:I love that they give the richest people in America, "famous people" a years worth of free food . But military soldiers dont even get a 10% discount... But man do I love their food
124149619252_10151024826814253:Salad, brown rice, 2 scoops pinto, med and hot salsa, corn, sour cream, ex cheese and guac on side. Or crispy chicken tacos with cheese and lettuce and hot salsa and sour cream on side since I take them home so they don't get soggy.
124149619252_10153806089609253:you promote "healthy" non-gmo foods and then put up something like this? Kinda contradictory don't you think?
124149619252_156053474470:I think it is a great idea. I'm still waiting ( and waiting) for my Chipotle to serve Margaritas. They've been promising they will soon for months now.
124149619252_10153262094399253:Yum, thanks! My fave...always add hot sauce and lime juice to my avocado mash! Hey...just an FYI Chipotle Mexican Grill...I'm a huge fan, but lately at several different locations I keep seeing the employees shake the meat scoop and make it very obvious that they are trying to cut back on the meat they serve. I don't know if that's a HQ mandate or indiviudal Franchisee's - but it doesn't look good to the customer...look's cheap.  Charge me what you want and give me an appropriate portion. How bout' considering having a 4 oz scoop...and fill it up. But thanks for being such a great choice anyway. Whenever I'm out for the day or longer, I check my app for a Chipotle Mexican Grill.
124149619252_10152343053104253:Not a real holiday????  Seriously?  I don't care what religion you are, it's an American cultural holiday that celebrates spring, if nothing else.  (Call me crazy, but I'm pretty sure bunnies and colored eggs don't ACTUALLY have anything to do with Christianity.)    Enjoy your holidays while they last, because pretty soon we won't have any left.  Just ask the folks who have to work over Thanksgiving because of nothing but corporate greed.  As an agnostic to Chipotle, I say "Cheers!"
124149619252_10152424290107741:people of the world Avril lavigne dide't call me yet if there is a mix up some wheres its my looks it's not my fault that i am good looking but i would love to see canada and u s soldiers dress up like starwars troopers because it would look so epic and i also would love to see a lot of people holding signs in the whole wide world that says free Hugs of Kindness i think it would help a lot of people when thay are sad i believe it would save a lot of people lives as well its all most like being a Hero because all you people are worth more then a million dollars.

124149619252_10151839071994253:So good!!!! Went last night!! But a bit expensive. 25 euro for two burritos, guac and chips, and one drink. Insane.
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken burrito with white rice, lettuce, cheese, tomatos and sour cream with no beans. That is what i always order when I go to chipotle :)
124149619252_109031815838831:I went to the hurst tx loc last week waited and waited on UNsweet tea....never got any more put put...but they filled up the ice machine.....the tea was for my diabetic husband...i ended up getting him sprite...i visit that loc atleast once a week  
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak Burrito Bol with black beans, lettuce (just a little and on the bottom), tomato, corn salsa, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream, gaucomole. yum.
124149619252_212886842115332:Wow, the FREEbie wanters are pretty out of touch with reality. That rare occasion with free burritos was simply a promotion to help more realize how tasty & worthy their food is to buy... to support in the future. In reality nothing comes free, btw. People are paying for it somewhere along the line. Careful with giving into tempting greedy entitlement expectations... it's an ugly path.  Besides, last night's great event gave us a SIGNIFICANT discount & proceeds went donated to the hardworking & small family farmers who TRULY need & deserve our support for the great food they cultivate & share with us! That which Chipotle beautifully commits to serving & showcases in their delicious food:)  Keep up the goodness, Chipotle & crew!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Would it be so ridiculous to have a Burrito Member Club? I have eaten so many friggin burritos at chipotle that I think getting a "free" one every once in awhile wouldn't hurt! I mean seriously, even if it was every 20 burritos! It'd just be awesome to have a burrito card to swipe every time I eat there. My wife and I ponder every time we're at chipotle on how many times we've actually had a chipotle burrito (bowl, tacos, etc.). 
124149619252_10153009001449253:Ummm blasphemy!!! Chipotle always trys to switch it up and play games.. its all good, though. I still love you, baby
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito with white rice, double steak, and cheese. Might be one of the easiest and simplest orders around!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Except the fact Chipotle is a McDonalds subdivision...  I think they're great, Burritos are great size. Except, one thing. Everyone and their dog goes there.. 
124149619252_10153009001449253:Ciera Martinez i cant find your comment in this to reply to...but we have one in salt lake but thats like 30 minutes from my house! we had them in seattle and i was addicted!!! i misssssss chipotle!
124149619252_10153009001449253:First I want to say what a great leap towards compassion and sustainability to go 100% organic and cutting out the inhumane pork. As a vegan,  I love Chipotle,  However Chipotle social media team should consider that cross contamination is happening.  Fellow vegans finding chicken and other meat in their sofritas. Employees using the meat spoon to serve.  Also the cheese and dairy sometimes taints the guac. With  the speed and volume with which the food is served,  Measures should be taken to ensure this does not happen. For some,  it's a choice,  for others it's allergies.  I can't tell you how many times I avoided guac because there was cheese or sour cream In  the tray.  What if the beef was tainted with e coli and an employee used the spoon to serve sofritas?  Bad business practice.  Please take note.  Melbourne Florida Thank you.
124149619252_10151053134024253:On a C-17 on the way back to the desert sandbox back in 2004. Dropped off a critical patient in Texas and changed planes in Ohio. Thankfully a Chipotle was outside the base gates!

124149619252_10151058843154253:New LEED certifications have been announced at a furious pace this month. We begin with the Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant in Gurnee, IL, which earned LEED Platinum under the new LEED for Retail platform. The freestanding building was completed last year and includes a 2,500-gallon underground water cistern for rainwater harvesting, LED lighting and Energy Star-rated kitchen equipment. Having trouble spotting the restaurant? Hint: look for the roof-mounted wind turbine.
124149619252_10153792851004253:Just had 2 burrito bowls this week and I'm still alive!!! Have to admit I was scared to go in for a while but I bit the bullet bc I couldn't stay away any longer....it was fabulous <3
124149619252_10151089035244253:Best...Laurel, Md (quick quick quick), Mediocre...Greenbelt, MD & Bowie, MD (wait time isn't THAT bad but quick when u get to the counter), WORST...CLINTON, MD (the longest line bcuz they are sooooo sloooooow, they don't know their products, did I mention SLOW???  Be prepared to be in line a good 45 min.  Their excuse...we have new people working here.  Same old excuse for a year now!  PLEASE help them.)
124149619252_10153780999604253:we LOVE Chipotle Mexican Grill.  The no antibiotic, hormone free meat and the fresh in-store cut veggies.  Please do not change things.  If veggies and cheese are pre-chopped what's the use? The thing that made Chipotle amazing  was that the food was REAL and made right in front of you.  Pre-chopped tomatoes? Yikes that no good.  Also, we believe this whole e. coli thing is sabotage.by biotech, chemical industry.  Most have come to this conclusion and years from now the truth will come out.  Stay real and do not give up your integrity.  Thanks and Merry Christmas.
124149619252_10151024826814253:veggie bowl..lime rice, peppers & onions, blk beans,  litle mild salsa, sr. cr, guaq & lettuce!  ok.. now i'm not hungry.... yes i am.. dang the power of suggestion! :)
124149619252_10153706556384253:Chipotle, PLEASE and I know I speak for many people PLEASE stop with small portions of food, I can't get full from a spoon not even full with brown rice.

124149619252_10153246130479253:That's fair, and that could be accomplished. But I would say the chance's of you becoming sick or damaged from GMO altered crops are much lower than being damaged from your average activities throughout the day.  Just saying, the benefits of GMO's have allowed farmers to feed the world at a reasonable cost. Are the chemical companies benefiting economically? You bet they are, but not at the sole cost of the consumer.
124149619252_10151316869709253:That's nice! What a nice company that give their employees the day to spend New years with their family!
124149619252_10153215460149253:I applied at chipotle and during my interview I was asked to write an essay about the company since then they are still waiting. WHAT A JOKE FOR MINIMUM WAGE. YEAH RIGHT.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Did anyone else get screwed over? Why advertise only to not have any Sofritas and not fulfill the offer? So totally stupid!
124149619252_10151486609219253:Anything but meat and guacamole!! But gotta say, Taco Bell's Cantina Veggie Burrito got ya beat!! Their black beans have much better taste. Chipotle's are very bland. ...try them alone and see what I mean. ;)
124149619252_10152560126959253:Burrito bowl, chicken, white rice, black beans, fajita veggies, lettuce, cheese, and 3 sides of sour cream....
124149619252_10153377528249253:Chipotle has become a favorite for me not only for the food ( that I love ) but also for what they do.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Fajita burrito (peppers and onions) with half chicken, half steak, tomatillo green sauce, double sour cream and cheese, chips and red hot sauce, washed down with coke with lemon =D

124149619252_145246312263952:my husband and I went for the first time to your restaurant tonight and we just loved the food. It was fresh and very tasty.
124149619252_10153246130479253:You're going to stop selling soft drinks completely??  All soft drinks currently being sold there are made with GMO corn syrup! Wow, what will you be replacing them with?
124149619252_156053474470:Please, please, PLEASE make this a regular practice at all your locations, especially the location in Newport News, VA!
124149619252_10153489055424253:I went highly out off my way in London for a burrito. It probably cost $30+ after you figure the conversion rate and train costs.
124149619252_10153656854824253:Jackie Donnawell good ol memories we smashed guac like there is no tomorrow but nobody did it smiling like that LOL
124149619252_10151037650024253:I agree with Howard, I love that brown rice is an option!! For the chipotle fans, if you've never tried it, please do! It's healthier and has more texture and flavor, but doesn't change the overall taste of your burritos, taco, bowls etc.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito - White Rice, Fajita Veggies, Chicken, Mild Salsa, Corn Salsa, Cheese, Sour Cream, Lettuce - Yummo!!
124149619252_115365598544868:I work for chipotle and I think its great and the ppl are great if you all new something about food with integrity u would no that you are getting the best... we take pride in our food and our work!
124149619252_213189592025031:That's not an open mind. I am not ignorant. No one mentioned Devil worship except you. No one is stopping you from planting a tree.
124149619252_10153388589524253:Just make sure it's not GMO, and don't raise the price. I like it how it is. Someone mentioned fat on the meat, I wonder if it's different by store. The one by me is all meat. Does Chipotle use sea salt?
124149619252_10153405438314253:Does anyone from idaho know when the new chipotle on the blvd in nampa will be open?? I'm guessing mid july
124149619252_10153389325099253:Chipotle Mexican Grill have you tested your cumin to see if it's a peanut-free one or not in light of the massive peanut-cumin recall? I miss eating Chipolte but after getting sick at a regular mexican restaurant from peanut-tainted cumin, I don't want to  take the chance...
124149619252_10153009001449253:Sarah Delozier Katie Jackson Jordan Skinner lol dare we switch it up from a bowl for the sake of free chipotle
124149619252_10151053134024253:On my waterfront deck at the beach, w/chips, guac & Diet Coke...my idea of heaven on earth! Parents sent Chipotle in a cooler to the beach w/my sister since the closest Chipotle is 67 miles away!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Love the one in Aventura FL and Little Rock, AR. Please open one in Hot Springs, AR and Miami Shores, FL
124149619252_10153088156639253:Sierra I'm so bummed that I'll miss this one???? you better be there and have enough fun for the both of us!
124149619252_10152805746454253:White and Brown Rice, extra rice, no beans, chicken and barbacoa, extra meat, hot, sour cream and extra cheese.... Damnit, now I want Chipotle.
124149619252_100780796665922:I agree with a couple others here.  Add queso as an option and you'll add an addiction to my addiction.
124149619252_10152196601534253:Yes Daniel Bonny this was yesterday afternoon. Waiting in line for two hours at this HUUUUUT and they didn't even have sofritas... but I shredded the gnar afterwards so it was ~~chill~~
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thanks for going non-GMO. Your setting a great example. If people only educated themselves on what GMOs actually are, they would care a whole lot more.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Pancheros out of fargo ND always has free lunch specials and they taste a lot better. Just saying there is such thing as a free lunch. 
124149619252_10151024826814253:I order this all the time: bowl, w.rice, black beans, chicken, green salsa, corn, lettuce, YUMMY!!! Kudos to Vernon Hills, IL Chipotle
124149619252_100780796665922:The only thing Qdoba has going for it is the queso, that's all I ever hear that anybody thinks is great about it.  So if you're bent on queso, go get a cup of it next door and get your bowl on at Chipotle.  I would argue that pehaps Chipotle's menu is a little TOO simplified.  I've seen people in front of me having quesadillas and tacos made when before that I didn't even know they were possibilities!

124149619252_10153389325099253:In georgia, where I was attempting to get a vegetarian Sufritas burrito, and noticed that it is kept in front of the meats...to have their juices drip into,.... as well as there being chunks of chicken in it.  Is this the way you roll?  Oh, and when I nicely told the manager about it, she merely nodded and smiled.  I got the impression that she already knew about it, and didn't care.
124149619252_10153185651299253:Good! Thank you for allowing your employees to spend time with their families. Corporate world, take notice.
124149619252_10151961054499253:U guys are rude..just email the company stop posting stuff like that on a public site..ride folks....smh
124149619252_10153792851004253:Bowl with white rice, pinto beans, chicken (sometimes I go double), cheese and sour cream. The perfect Chipotle dish.

124149619252_10153555173409253:Love Chipotle, but so disappointed today. I went to a different location today, and it was horrible. When you crave something that you love and you don't get what you wanted...breaks the heart. Not fresh at all and very dry. Bummer. Major let down this evening. ; (
124149619252_10151258924194253:As an employee of Chipotle thank u for allowing us to spend time with out loved ones. Seeing as i am in the food industry...not many places close for thanksgiving. Or any holiday for thay matter. But Chipotle is the best company i have ever worked for. Thank u again for closing so i can spend time with my family. Go team #1674 Chipotle Moline, Illinois.
124149619252_261338423981855:Dear chipotle, I'm getting sick of driving to Nashville just for chipotle. You need to put one in Clarksville, TN. I guarantee it will do well.

124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl with white rice, extra pinto beans, tomato and green salsa, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole. Yum!
124149619252_10151024826814253:It's all about the burrito. Women can eat burrito bowls -- but if you're a man, you gotta go for the burrito. I start off more differently than others -- two tortillas. Then mad amounts of white rice because I don't get beans. Half chicken half steak. Then corn (although the old corn was thousands and millions and trillions of times better than the new corn) and sour cream. I then smell my burrito and rub it against my face.
124149619252_10151086390274253:So because Jen Kessy and April Ross didn't go to chipotle today, they don't deserve to be wished luck?   @Garrett Chipotle isn't particularly greasy and in terms of fast food, it rather healthy. However,  until you burn as many calories as the average olympian, you really can't talk about olympic food.
124149619252_10151024826814253:I'm addicted to the Steak Burrito Bowl w/pinto beans, white rice, pico de gallo, green sauce, cheese & lettuce. So delicioso!
124149619252_221129944611968:I've been craving Chipotles like I'm pregnant or something. Just seeing this news bit made me insta-hungry. I wish had money to spare :(

124149619252_10152406485254253:Chipotle seems to pride it self on being unique, politically correct and environmentally conscious. Yet in Texas and others states, your company allows people to openly carry guns into the restaurant.Why is such potentially dangerous behavior tolerated?  I am a patron of Chipotle and I find this appalling and completely hypocritical. Show some respect for the saftey and well-being of your patrons and do not bow to the insanity of the gun lobby.
124149619252_10152949800154253:So proud of your employees. I've never been, but am going to go out of my way to eat at your restaurants.  Happy New year ! See you in 2015 !!
124149619252_10151973813714253:I went with my family at the chipotle great mall in militias CA. We were dressed up in costumes (my daughter, my fiancée and I). The manager tried to charge us $23 for two bowls no drinks! When I told him that it should be $6 he gave us a bad attitude. I had to call a friend of mine that is a manager at another chipotle to send me the details from corporate about what is eligible for the $3. I was so annoyed that on a fun night he was giving us such trouble. Two bowls with no drinks should not be $23 even at full price. :| after I got the details from corporate I showed it to the manager and he said "oh I didn't know..." How can he not know?! Especially as a manager! Not to mention that this was closing time so I assume they charged people wrong the entire day. What a horrible experience. Chipotle is our favorite place to eat but that location is just horrible!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thank you Chipotle Mexican Grill For setting the bar we deserve. I support you and you have a new patron for life! Chipotle will be my #1 go to choice when eating out.
124149619252_10152406485254253:You gained a customer and lost one in the same day. Too bad you gave into  Bloombergs Monsanto Mommy and her band of raving fools.

124149619252_10153351140389253:Please please please make all of the ingredients GMO free. i think the landslide of consumer support is beyond your imagining. Every time we come to the USA... it is Chipotle we frequent because of the wholesome food.

124149619252_10153888324619253:Not to anyone's fault, I didn't know the free burrito link would expire after 1 day. Oh well, no Chipotle for me then.

124149619252_100721619944214:oh what the fuck is this, Chipotle?! Keep it up and you and FaceBitch will find yourself on my list of businesses I don't patronize.
124149619252_10153246130479253:If GMO's are so safe then why did Monsanto pay Obama $5M to put a no liable clause for GMO safety against Monsanto in the 2012 farm bill? Yes you can look it up, it hasn't changed.
124149619252_10153514914799253:Except when you get a crappy roller and you get all chicken one bite, all sour cream the next and all guac (that's extra is that ok) in the next.
124149619252_10153806089609253:Looks good!  However,  Chipotle needs to ensure the health of its customers. I stopped eating a Chipotle because staff did not like changing their gloves-Safety first Chipotle!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Most ppl against GMOs have no idea why they're against it. They never actually research. They depend on info fed to them through a link or documentary.

124149619252_10153009001449253:I usually get chicken in my meals here but the Sofritas are actually fantastic. Don't knock it before you try it.
124149619252_10153246130479253:So you say, it doesnt taste any different, so how would I know. Your goal of making money is more successful with GMOs since theyre cheaper, but Ill take you at your word.
124149619252_10152250518069253:No believable to say the least. It would be nice, however, if you would offer a coupon of some sort. A BOGO would be awesome.

124149619252_10153009001449253:I tried the sofritas in a burrito today for lunch and it tasted very similar to turkey chili. I am a certified carnivore and I didn't feel like I was missing anything. I will definitely be getting this again. So excited for my upcoming free meal!
124149619252_10152406485254253:Chipotle has banned the term 2 nd A m e n d m e n t from this page Yep sounds like they like taking your freedom of speech away. Sad I will never eat there again!
124149619252_10153405438314253:Chipotle is almost a religion. Ever notice how passionate guests are when they're ordering? Once you've found your manic ratio it's NOTHING to be tampered with! ????????
124149619252_10153009001449253:Yea umm it's suppose to start snowing earlier than expected in CT :-/ I don't want to go out if it's bad
124149619252_10153246130479253:I love how people think this makes their burritos healthy XD rofl. They should genetically modify their ingredients more.  Pick a modification that will make their burritos actually not taste like leftovers wrapped in cardboard.  :p
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie burrito bol. White rice. Black beans(xtra beans). Sour cream. Cheese. Corn. Medium salsa. With a touch of hot salsa. Bag o chips.   :)   Yummm!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Nope, don't do Tofu... Mostly because I'm deathly allergic to soy and I'd like to not die just for a "free" burrito.

124149619252_10153806089609253:Chipotle is being sabotaged by the big gmo corporations It is the only fast food chain that is is gmo free and 95% organic. Dont let the big evil corps win.

124149619252_10153388589524253:The ones made by and with flour are thicker than what you buy at the store and they have no preservatives so they taste better, just flour, lard ( hell yeah!) and maybe salt?

124149619252_10153792851004253:Chipotle needs to come up with a serious mktg initiative to get people to forget about their recent food safety issues
124149619252_10153246130479253:So you're spending more money on product that isn't even scientifically proven to be healthier for you, and people are happy about this? Let's hope they make the profit off people who jump aboard the Buzzword bandwagon now that it's "GMO-free".
124149619252_10152808069134253:Always so crowded we skipped it this year. Perhaps starting earlier the crowds wouldn't be so bad but the around the building crowd is too much!
124149619252_10152538683134253:I wonder if the avocado growers can communicate with their avocados telepathically the same way the pig farmer does?
124149619252_10152883478794253:Well I know the story but the company needs to address it national to make amends. Even though it was just one employee it still is getting a bad rap from it.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Kevin: nonsense. They're giving customers what they want. That's ALWAYS the staple of running a successful business.  The customers drive it, not the company.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Why are people against this? GMO's are labeled on menus in other countries, we have a right to know what we eat.
124149619252_10153150981964253:Also, Chipotle..me and the girlfriend have had food poisoning twice now from the Bethel Road store in Columbus Ohio. My buddy just had that locations food a couple weeks ago and he as well got food poisoning.
124149619252_10153656854824253:He's not wearing cut glove, they are doing this way to slow it would take forever just for one batch. You should have all your ingredients ready before you start. Finally that girl did not have her hair tucked back and up in a pony tail.

124149619252_10153246130479253:I seriously love you. & to be honest I didn't like the food. But I eat mostly non gmo, so I'll be eating here more often!

124149619252_10151486609219253:Chipotle was better when they cooked their beans and meats on the grill and stove. Now the use some hot water bath system to heat the food, does not taste as good and you get cold burritos!!

My hubby loves it he can eat chipotle everyday. I'm not going back to polaris branch..  I will just go to the one in Lewis center ohio ..

124149619252_10153389325099253:We need many more Chipotle's in the world. Everywhere and every time I go to one the line is out the door. Minnesota needs MORE CHIPOTLE PLEASE!
124149619252_10151258924194253:Yay I get to see my daddy :'D Thank you Chipotle for the opportunities you give us as employees and for taking time to understand what we want too.
124149619252_10152323527922741:Kacie Priebe most of the population does not take antibiotics. In fact alot of people are strictly against putting them in their body. Im pretty sure you are an uneducated person who doesn't have a clue what your talking about here
124149619252_10152453918534253:Chipotle is starting to piss me off.....prices going up and today the Mesquite Chipotle didn't have black beans or tortillas. They refused to give us a discount....

124149619252_454413931302356:Great business decision, piss-off 90% of your customers to appease the radical and wacko 10%  or less...
124149619252_185864848093833:I think Chipotle should be using all organic ingredients (at least all of the veggies) brown rice and whole wheat tortillas.  Plus, some meatless options like Quorn or Gardein.  Still love Chipotle but it could be even better.
124149619252_10153395310879253:Why suddenly are all these retailers and businesses showing their support for gay marriage.  Why not show your support for orphans or the Christians in the Middle East.

124149619252_10152250518069253:You should totally honor it. Do you realize how much free advertising & new business that picture is bringing in? I would have never thought to follow/like Chipotle without that pic (even though I love the food).
124149619252_10152949800154253:Have never had Chipotle before, planning on stopping in soon to show my thanks for the employee(s) for standing in solidarity. <3

124149619252_10153246130479253:Chipotle, there is zero evidence that GMOs cause harm. This will easily double or triple the price of your food, and I am just not willing to pay that. Please do not cater to these fearmongers. And to those who think organic means no pesticides, you're wrong. They DO use pesticides. ... so called organic pesticides which have barely been tested. Meanwhile standard pesticides have gone through rigorous testing.
124149619252_164816057005566:Some people are so bigoted against tofu, you say the word and they react.  Many have never even tried it.  I get it in Chinese food all the time and it is good.  I like straight vegetables too.  I grew up eating meat but once I really thought about the blood and carcass processing that disgusted me more than soybean ever could.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I have a friend who is vegan and she doesn't like sofritas but I tried it any way and it's the bomb digity ... 10/10 would eat again ... I WILL be eating this again ...

124149619252_10152250518069253:People are so gullible. I don't believe much of anything I see on facebook and I always check it out before reposting. I highly doubted it was real. lol.
124149619252_10152453918534253:Die hard fan here from the very beginning when the first restaurant opened in Denver in the old ice cream store.  Used to be more addicted to Chipotle Mexican Grill than I was to the Starbucks.

124149619252_10151089035244253:Oh Joe, my new favorite is Dover, Delaware of course. Your crew there is super fast. The place is nice and clean, and they made me feel like a super hero when I told them how it all started at the corner of Evans and Gilpin. I love my new town, but had to convince my new co-workers that McD's no longer has a stake in Chipotle.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie burrito with brown rice, black beans, corn and mild salsa, and guacamole.  Soooo yummy.  ^-^  I just wish the cilantro would go away.

124149619252_10152822056649253:So, I'm a bit confused. Is there gluten in this whole wheat flour?  My sister has celiac disease and can't have gluten.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Love sofritas, they aren't usually offered in our location. As a vegetarian, I always really appreciate the premium item of guacamole Chipotle
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito: Brown rice, fajitas, black beans, steak, and everything else on the right side... [all 3 sauces, corn, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce. Ya know, the works.] Sometimes my burrito is filled with so much that it rips. :p Hehe
124149619252_193346814021706:If you DON'T like Chipotle, then why on Earth would you click the LIKE button? And read their articles? And comment on it?
124149619252_10151316869709253:Heidi, we second that about FB's. YUCK! And we wanted to like it because it is 9 miles closer to us than Chipotle. But the extra 9 miles is a small price to pay we learned.
124149619252_10152626830924253:I have a friend who lives and dies chipotle. She eats it every day so you could say she's the Chipotle Jared.  I strongly recommend that you utilize her love of your food in a productive manner.  She's on the ground and you need ground troops.
124149619252_10151058843154253:Every Sun night I bet my fajita chicken bowl from this location!!! I LOVE the GURNEE Mills Location!!!!
124149619252_10150260445594253:Everyone says that these other places haber punch cards, our swipe cards, and that's great. But they probably have those because there is a chipotle in the neighborhood haha.  seriously though, chipotle does it without the card and I keep going back =)

124149619252_10153395310879253:Can you just wrap all burritos in this, forever? Or better yet, Reynolds Wrap just needs to make this an everyday product; it looks awesome!
124149619252_10152538683134253:$2.50 including tax for a tiny scoop of guac? No thanks, I'll bring my own avocado. Your guac is too bland anyway, throw some garlic in that, it's barely got any flavor.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito, brown rice, pinto beans, 2 scoops of Mild, cheese, guac & lettuce...I CRAVE this on a daily basis but am only able to indulge sometimes....LUV you CHIPOTLE!

124149619252_100780796665922:Ther's a Qdoba right across the street from my office (It's right out my window I'm looking right at it) but I'll walk the 5 blocks to get a Chipotle any day.  It's no contest It's Chipotle or no burrito at all!
124149619252_10150399959924253:I think the winning duo did a great job based on the commercial. Laugh if you will, but the commercial almost made me cry, and I believe the answer is "going back to the start."
124149619252_156053474470:I can't tell you how many times I've thought about how cool it would be if Chipotle delivered. This makes me unbelievably happy! I can't wait till it comes to other cities!!
124149619252_160584150738666:I am a huge Chipotle fan, I was at the opening in Paris and to tell you the truth it is was really disappointing. The portions are ridiculously small (the size of a french McWrap) and it's propably the most expensive Chipotle in the World: 9 euros! I wouldn't mind paying the 9euros for the same portions as the US/UK, but comon I still had room for a Big Mac after eating my Chipotle burrito...Something's not right, fix it Chipotle!
124149619252_10153389325099253:Absolutely love Chipotle we need one here in Sevierville Tennessee I only get it when we are visiting in Ohio !

124149619252_182076481805338:To my knowledge as a service manager the chip recipe has not changed in my nearly 6 years with Chipotle.  Still fresh cut and squeezed lime and kosher salt, made 2-3x a day.  Same as always.  Also, while our meat only qualifies as "naturally raised" (it is fed a vegetarian, not organic diet as would be required to call it "organic"), we now serve somewhere around 20% organic beans in our stores and are making our way towards serving more, same goes for our salsas and other produce (we've also begun locally sourcing during summer months and whenever possible...so you're also supporting local agriculture by dining with us).
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito, white rice, black beans, all the sauces, extra cheese, lettuce. Done. It's the only restaurant where I order the same thing every time.
124149619252_10153246130479253:CHIPOTLE is my FAVORITE!!! Ask where I want to eat at any given time.. & I'll say what? CHIPOTLE! That's what!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Have had the Sofritas Salad Bowl 3 times now and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Will be marking my calendar for the 26th!
124149619252_10152927494854253:I will support your chain as it was one employee, I have heard employes at burger places making spitburger jokes when cops come in as well as one of the sub places. This incident is not a corporate stance like Chik fil does, if you people do not like a whole chain cause of one employee  does somthing go eat more chicken or better yet fight against police abuse so there is a better chance that a handful of officers will not tarnish all police reputations.
124149619252_10151089035244253:We go to sterling, va.  More than 10 miles away...it's a darn shame!!!  Y'all need to come to Leesburg!  You'd make a killing.

124149619252_10153246130479253:Actually not the biggest fan of Chiptle but I'll eat there now just to support a good cause.  Everyone else can go eat Taco Bell.

124149619252_175950982559852:Elixir of Eternal Life!  The president of Kazakhstan  has asked scientists to invent an elixir of eternal life. He is 70 years old and feels great, having governed for 20 years with an iron hand a country the size of Western Europe, and nothing can stop him from doing that for  the next ten years, according to La Stampa, indicating that the Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has recently asked how can he manage to remain loved by almost the entire population of his country.  "I saw the results of an independent survey, which states that 92% of the Kazakhs love and respect him!"-Berlusconi exclaimed, with envy.  But like any powerful leader, Nursultan Nazarbayev cannot control one thing: time irreversible transition, more specifically, life and death. Thus, in a speech at a university in Astana, Nazarbayev urged the scientists of the new research institute in Kazahstan to study the "rejuvenation of the body" and "human genome, the production of human tissues and the creation of gene-based drugs."  The leader from Astana expressed his desire saying that: "People my age hope that this will happen as soon as possible". Some months ago, at a meeting of the governmental Commission for science and research, he had set the task to "ïnvent a remedy against old age and to develop methods for natural rejuvenation and immortality."

124149619252_185864848093833:@Allison Holms- I believe what you say. I have had several bouts with staph infections. Antibiotics hardly work, it can be painful dealing with infections. I'm starting to think I should be vegan as well. I've heard several people doing that and it has worked. Since I have stopped working with meat, my skin already appears a little better.

124149619252_10153009001449253:Naw. . . Fyi I've tried tofu and didn't enjoy it even a little bit. . . Hey i don't hate vegetarians hell i have vegetarians friends like i said but I will never be one . . . I'm an omnivore and always will be
124149619252_10152250518069253:Not true, you guys use to send out free burrito post cards when you were opening up new locations:) was awesome because you opened 2 in my hood! So two free burritos!
124149619252_199537401806:I literally have 3 chipotles all within 10 minutes or less of me and a 4 and maybe 5th about 15min so I'm set. Just make a breakfast for the clevand, Ohio ones and u have me
124149619252_134085872963:Gayest shit I've seen in a while, they don't deserve money or a party, just a stern kick to the throat followed by mace in their eyes.
124149619252_10152004082504253:I was wondering if I had a bag that hadn't gone through the final processes of printing yet...  Good ol' Lorem Ipsum.
124149619252_10151053134024253:the coolest place I'll ever eat a Chipotle burrito is in New Orleans when you FINALLY open a restaurant there this September.....it's been a long time coming and I've been waiting forever.  Can't Wait!
124149619252_240071849428248:Sam, you need to please follow us on foursquare first - otherwise your check-ins won't count toward the badge. And you can check in once per day at any location; it doesn't need to be the same one. - Joe
124149619252_10152881172544253:This was amazing & so tasty!! Have had it at office for lunch & again at my preteen daughter's birthday party. Never disappointing!! Food is also a hit!!
124149619252_10152250518069253:For those that missed the logic portion of the show: To the people complaining about Chipotle not honoring the fake ad, especially those of you calling them cheap, greedy, etc- What if someone posted an ad that said free pizza, beer, or whatever else was being given away at your address? Would you honor it? Do you think you would "owe" free food the people who showed up? You didn't make, nor condone, the ad, but since it has your name and/or address on it you should have to honor it? Come on now...
124149619252_10151024826814253:I've had this... um... a "few" times over the last few years since discovering Chipotle.  Bowl... extra black beans, no rice, steak, extra fresh tomato salsa, red tomatillo sauce, sour cream.  Corn salsa on the side with some chips.  Done.  Hard to beat at anywhere near the price...
124149619252_10151258924194253:Good Glad at least one place wants to take the time to be thankful for something Instead of letting their greed skip and move straight to Christmas
124149619252_10151024826814253:Double rice, peppers, Double chicken, Extra tomatos corn sour cream green salsa, little bit of lettace and cheese
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie bowl, brown rice, black beans, with mild and corn salsa, and a little sour cream.  Great fiber and flavor when you're trying to watch what you are eating.  (Weight watchers)
124149619252_164816057005566:7% of the population is vegetarian or vegan and we are  growing every day! Thanks Chipotle for the tofu burrito. Come to locations all over the country please!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl wit white rice onions and peppers black beans pico de gallo corn salsa cheese sour cream and lettuce.... im hungry now!!!
124149619252_179271002091714:My name is TEE, I no the perfect location 4 the next great restaurant...In Washington d,c on NEW YORK AVE N.E 20002!!! Plz consider it honestly and if u consider it I can be reached on 240-491-2842 or my email is dixonletisha@ymail.com!!!! Thx
124149619252_109031815838831:Yeah! I was shocked when my Hubby  returned home w dinner for the fam n said it was free. That was sooo cool! We go at least twice a week. I'd rather give my kiddies rice n beans etc. than junk food :). Thank you chipotle in Clermont!!!!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Every Chipotle I have been to has been great! That's the thing that brings me back...always consistently delicious/fresh!
124149619252_213189592025031:Patrick? Youre a moron too. Why is is that humans have to be one extreme or the other? You believe in god? good for you. you dont believe in going green? good for you. but coe on guys, we all live on the planet, and no matter what you do and dont believe, were messing it up. earth day is not a conspiracy holiday made up by tree huggers and devil worshipers, its a day to realize that we are all lazy, selfish people and cant take care of the one and only Earth we have. Ignorance spreads like wildfires, so STOP IT.
124149619252_205455487672:I appreciate your expansion.  But, I surely wish you would get yourselves all across America before you head that way.
124149619252_10152108930454253:I hope and pray that a new Chipotle appears in a city near me in 2014!!! Peachtreecity, Newnan, Fayetteville Ga are all great candidates........ Just saying. Have a Happy Newyear!!!
124149619252_10153034270734253:Can you guys please build a chipotle in deltona.. Or orange city or even deland would be great!!! The closest location is either lake Mary or Sanford which is twenty minutes taking the highway. We need something local
124149619252_10152715839394253:cant do burritos, BUT that's why I love ya'll---I can feel safe eating gluten free with tacos or a bowl :) (a bowl is 2 or 3 meals for me)
124149619252_10152748433069253:Chipotle Mexican Grill Is there a limit to one person can buy? Let's say I come in with my costume and buy 4 burritos, can I do that? or is it one per costumer?
124149619252_10152385442142741:Would it change the way I eat carrots? No. I knew that. And I realize that our 'society' is large enough that some smarty hundreds of years ago probably already modified carrots to grow year-round and started growing them in patches that harvest year-round.  Oh wait... That would be logical.
124149619252_10153555173409253:On behalf of all vegans . stop putting the cheese next to the guac Please .. every time i want guac its full of cheese bits !
124149619252_10153656854824253:WOW amazing to see so many people complain for a great product to a company that's doing fast food fresh and right. If you think it's pricey, or if you have a problem with your order ask to speak to a manager.  They are all really nice and willing to help give great customer service.   I don't see the golden arches or the king making fresh anything and people complain less!
124149619252_156053474470:ahhhh...columbus ohio....thats where i had my first chiptole burrito while attending ohio state 10yrs ago....and ever since i've been hooked!!!!....thanks for bringing that over to philadelphia pa!!!!....it was a hard few years not having yall...and now i can have one....or two...at my disposal :o)
124149619252_10153246130479253:I think this is lame. I eat at Chipotle because I like the way the food tastes, not because I'm deluding myself that it's healthy.   Why not stand up for a rational discourse on food, rather than play into the fears of the misinformed?
124149619252_192723894104403:I don't know where to post this, but I'd like to compliment the awesome staff u have at chipotles Colorado Spring southgate location. They r fast, friendly n the place is ALWAYS clean! Keep up the good work!!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Lol you guys are still awesome! As I said in my repost and tag the best food babies are conceived at Chipotle!
124149619252_10152004082504253:It's National Treasure for Chipotle Mexican Grill....  Follow the clues to your nearest Chipotle, and spend away........................
124149619252_267832333301923:you are buying the bag for charity.. not the free burrito, the sign says all proceeds go to the Chipolte Cultivate Corp.  you get tha bag and burrito as a thank you
124149619252_10152407734029253:Really wish you had not done this.  VERY small minded.  Will not ever use your services - Unless you retract this publicly, I will never come back.
124149619252_185864848093833:Terrible to make animals we eat suffer as well. On another note, thanks  Chepotley for this Brown-Eye openner
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thank you Chipotle for removing the toxic GMOs that were poisoning your customers. What is the molecule level of your guacamole? I can only eat avocados raised under strict low-molecule conditions. Please advise.
124149619252_10152949800154253:Time to start doing some major PR work because words spreading fast and a small link in a comment section will not stop a sinking ship!!!
124149619252_10151307314369253:this is ridiculous... there are many that don't celebrate xmas and want chipotle!! why can't you guys do what your former parent company is doing and stay open for the day?
124149619252_10151089035244253:Best one I've ever been to was the one on the edge of the University of Dayton campus when I was in college and law school. They were awesome!
124149619252_10152925087634253:In observance of those that risk their lives to keep us safe my wallet will be permanently CLOSED to Chipotle.
124149619252_130482563683418:We eat out once a week at my house and many weeks it is Chipotle!  Love their food and simple menu and reasonable prices and nice portions of food.
124149619252_10152323527922741:WE ARE DYING FROM EATING. what a progression. We are soo intelligent nuff said Thank you Quinn  love your consciousness
124149619252_10152250518069253:They actually had this special a couple years ago. I remember getting a free burrito... I thought they were doing this promotion again. Lame!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl with brown rice, fajita peppers & onions, black beans, medium tomato salsa, corn salsa, pico, sour cream, guacamole and cheese.
124149619252_10152925087634253:We sincerely apologize for what happened. If you'd like, here is our statement that provides more info on the incident and our actions: http://chip.tl/NYPDStatement -Candice
124149619252_10151719407409253:It's time sensitive. You have to get all of the words entered and submitted fast. I did mine in about a minute and it worked.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I actually like the Sofritas.  I switched to being vegetarian in December and ordered this and was surprised at the taste.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Fajita burrito bowl with whatever meat looks best that day, hot red salsa, pico de gallo, corn salsa, lettuce, and cheese. Yum!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito, chicken and steak white rice fresh and green salsa lettuce sour cream, bag of chips and guacamole and a huge smile on this guys face
124149619252_10151185000424253:I am excited to see all the great costumes!  I look forward to serving the great people of Lima Ohio on this Halloween!
124149619252_10152250518069253:I just came here to check this. Thank you. @chipotle are your tortillas GMO free yet!? I still go there #burritobowl. #thankyou #gmofree 
124149619252_212886842115332:i work at chipotle and i still cant get enough of it i go there every day and get a 4.5lb burrito no joke we weighed them. i LOVE chipotle and represent with pirde
124149619252_10152990683604253:We have a restaurant opening (finally!!!) here in New Bern at the end of the month... My resolution... Done.
124149619252_10153246130479253:THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!!  I hope ALL restaurants follow your good example!  It is about time this country wakes up and catches up with the rest of the world as WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES want to eat whole foods that are not loaded with cheap fillers, chemicals, GMO's, pesticides, MSG, and artificial ingredients regardless of what the media, politicians, and lobbyists say.  They don't make up the majority of America.  The people do. I  hope your profits soar higher than ever before!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Chipotle,  THANK  YOU for not being afraid and "believing" in GOOD business and morals; like most of us were "NATURALLY" RAISED !
124149619252_163198123842255:first of all, i applaud your efforts to supply real food that is healthful and not artificial. GMOs are definitely artificial "Frankenscience" and should be banned in the United States. so thank you for taking such a bold step forward; your courage is commendable!  i do have a concern, however. here is a comment i will copy and paste for simplicity: good for them. but while they say the cows used for dairy are pastured cows that eat grass, that claim is not made for the steak; additionally, cows, pigs, and chickens raised for food, when not raised/labeled "organic," are fed diets of GMO soy, corn, & alfalfa.   so although the meat is free from antibiotics and produced from animals that get to run around, these animals are 100% GMO from the time they're born to the day they're slaughtered for use as food.  if it's not organic meat, it's GMO. people who eat animals who ate a diet of GMOs are still eating GMOs, and Chipotle needs to be clear about that.  i'm sick of the "naturally/humanely raised, free of antibiotics" label. there is nothing natural about a diet that is 100% GMO.  great that Chipotle is first out of the gate, and apparently has no current ties to previous investor, McDonald's.  personally, i adhere to a non-GMO diet and don't eat at Chipotle. even before i knew about GMOs, i didn't like their food. i also hate Moe's. Atlanta has Willy's Mexicana Grill, which knocks all their competitors out of the race as far as taste and quality. but i had to stop eating there because of GMOs.  as i said, great start, Chipotle, but what they need to be clear on is the animals raised for beef, pork, and chicken were all fed "vegetarian" GMO diets.  how does Chipotle respond to this issue? 
124149619252_10150399959924253:Joseph, well said.  Lesson learned by many:  participate in the marketing strategies of the company = best chance of winning.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Joe. Even though this was a hoax by no fault of your organization, it would be very beneficial to offer everyone a coupon for something off, ect.  This post looks like a big screw you.  If no one tried your food before, they sure won't now!
124149619252_10152406485254253:Thanks for your dose of sanity in this batcrap crazy world.  I think I'll have Chipotle for dinner!  :)
124149619252_10150399990734253:Cute costumes.  If you haven't seen their Back to the Start video, I recommend it. Check it out on youtube people! Warms my heart. :D
124149619252_10152883478794253:All this drama and I'm still interested in a career @Chipotle Mexican Grill. The meat is adobo marinated and I'm Filipino American. Makes some sense to me. Too bad I follow up on my app more than I eat at the place. Is that the prollem?
124149619252_10153734396969253:How come Chipotle does not provide black pepper anymore in their restaurants, even Dunkin Donuts, Burger King, and McDonald's  provides pepper, I expect more from Chipotle.
124149619252_156053474470:Holy freakin cow!!!!!!!!! I am so f'n jealous of Ohio right now!!!!!!!! They need to make this nation wide! As a matter of fact I would be pleased as pie is someone would build a chipolte in Connecticut even if they didnt deliver. That is as long as its in the Hartford Metro area!
124149619252_10153602183249253:Don't worry Chipoltle I know Monsanto will do anything to keep their profit going what's lying and making up crap about people who refuse to use their nasty Gmos when they are killing and injuring millions with them?!
124149619252_10152250518069253:I figured. Who ever made that ad didn't capitalize "March," and used an ugly assortment of fonts and alignments. Chipotle is too well branded for that to have actually come from Chipotle. Hah!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burriot bowl with white rice, blackk beans, barbacoa, mild salsa, cheese sour creme and lettuce...YUMMEH. Dying from not having my chipotle...nearest one is 100miles :( It's my addiction and i am so upset that I moved down here and there isn't one.
124149619252_10153872104594253:I love Chipotle! Thank you for going non-GMO!!! It means so much to us consumers that you care about our health and the environment.
124149619252_10151089035244253:It's gonna be Wilmington when it opens.  But I love the one near the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis that is also near the Holiday Inn on Washington Ave.   Lots of eclectic people watching can go down there while enjoying a chicken fajita burrito :)
124149619252_10153009001449253:Does anyone know if it HAS to be a burrito or can i get it in a bowl? And do i still get the promotion if i get it with a second meat?
124149619252_221129944611968:COME TO HUNTSVILLE, AL.  I'll quit my job and Run it for you, it's what I do and I love you guys that much! ;-)
124149619252_10151906029579253:I like how everyone is complaining about paying $3 for something that it normally about $7. It's a great deal,stop complaining.
124149619252_10152307671269253:Thank you chipotle for being GMO Free.  We also support your decision of buying beef from Australia. Keep up the good work and delivering absolutely healthy food
124149619252_10152357093419253:I'm at a Moe's right now since there isn't a Chipotle nearby and I'm really wishing I was at Chipotle! #MoesBlows
124149619252_164816057005566:Good god, Soy is so bad for people-no one needs that. Is it GMO free? Being pushed on you by the soy commodities brokers?
124149619252_10150719072154253:Going to Chipotle for the first time probably tomorrow in Tyler, Tx. Will give my response afterward!!! Hoping for deliciousness!!
124149619252_10153270305244253:Avila Faby ???????????? look amor to this Mexican food ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito Bowl: white rice, black beans, steak, mild (for the tomatoes), medium (for the flavor) and corn salsa (for the sweetness), cheese and sour creme. Then Chipotle Tobasco Sauce for the smokey heat. Mmm, so good. I haven't had that since... oh... yesterday for lunch.
124149619252_10152357093419253:And now I wanna go to chipotle... Haha.  If the Chipotle team is reading this..there's plently of us in Gloucester, VA that would love to have a location :)
124149619252_167132760066216:Five, seven, then five                                     syllables for Chipotle...                                       Think I'll have for lunch
124149619252_10153009001449253:Christina Maria it's worth it. Obviously I'm gonna throw the tofu burrito in the trash where it belongs. But hey free burrito.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Better stop serving food, then. Genetic engineering has been taking place in the form of selective breeding for thousands of years.
124149619252_10152028447324253:Wish that would happen up here in Alaska, Joe. A Chipotle burrito would do wonders to warm me up right about now!
124149619252_10151551513714253:Sorry Chad Smith there are only three this year, but you never know what will happen in years to come! In the meantime, we hope you can come see us at one of our three this year. - Joe
124149619252_10152250518069253:Rachel Kick Inez Chavez Navarro Jessica E Ferrer hahahahaha.... I know it! It was to good to be true! ???????? lol????????
124149619252_10153009001449253:Hey us NorthEastern ppl hav a huge snow storm so.alot of us are indoors can we get a extra day maybe like fri wen it all clears? #ChipotleMexicanGrill
124149619252_10151520750889253:you have to give free burritos everytime you post bad news, or at least that should be a rule. lol (:
124149619252_10151486609219253:Brown rice,black beans,fajita, fresh tomato salsa,medium salsa,corn,sour cream,glucamole,cheese,lettuce but in bowl... Yummy :)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Salad with chicken, black beans, medium salsa, corn salsa and chipotle vinegarette and a side of cilantro lime brown rice.
124149619252_185864848093833:For the people that say there is nothing wrong with eating food that has lived its whole life taking chemicals, thats your perogative. You can do that. However we need to be a little more observant and realize when there is a problem. My family has lived on Free range, organic, veggie fed natural beef, eggs and poultry for years now and we are all healthy. None of us have had to use antibiotics. So here is my theory. If we raise our animals in sanitary conditions and feed them what they are supposed to be fed then the chances of them getting sick are null, further if one is sick you do give it the proper medication and then choose to not serve it.. If you are breastfeeding and you are on medications do you still breastfeed? No, you stop. So why are we feeding our children food that has lived its life on medication?
124149619252_10153246130479253:Yeah now if they could cut the salt by 75%, it would palatable. Seriously, if they did that, I would be happy to eat there.
124149619252_10150298717314253:I fly from Prescott to Scottsdale AZ just because chipotle is a 10 minute walk from the airport.. Please open in Prescott!
124149619252_140229971715:What about the rest of the country????? I am going to call our place in KC and see if the rest of us Chipotle Lovers are included.
124149619252_10151961054499253:Wish I oils have been able to get 3 dollars food yesterday. They cheated my daughter she was a pumpkin but it was not good enough what a rip off 
124149619252_10151089035244253:any location ;) but now there is one close to where I live and it's in Easton mall, btw that Chipotle looks soooooooo different from where i have been
124149619252_10153246130479253:Good luck keeping your supply up and be prepared for more out of stock pork, chicken and beef at your local Chipotle!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Maple Ave in Vienna, VA. That place holds a lot of good memories.  But Germany def needs Chipotle as well!!!!!
124149619252_454413931302356:Since when did Christian views change? Ummm, I don't know, maybe since Jesus died in the first place? Since women stopped being owned by their husbands, like they were in Jesus' time? I sure hope the folks who are boycotting stick with it, because I will enjoy my Chipotle dining experience (along with my husband and four kids=a nice big bill!) much more knowing I'm surrounded only by those who practice the Christian values of tolerance, love and equality. I don't want to expose my children to hate and prejudice.
124149619252_10152599784994253:It's great food, the prices are now outrageous.  That increase has out priced our family of 5 now.  It's very sad!
124149619252_10153240834269253:Even though I never heard of you until Natural News mentioned you went GMO free, I want to thank you. Now I can eat Mexican food again, whoot!!
124149619252_205455487672:So now that you've jumped over the pond and finally arrived in Europe...How about a Chipotle in GERMANY...We're still waiting patiently :-)
124149619252_163075200578:It's a little bit of a trip from Columbus, Ohio :-(     Is this coming our way :-)  :-)   Anytime soon :-)
124149619252_10153656854824253:I used to work at Chipotle and I can say that 100% this is absolutely how they make guacamole. All the way down to chopping the ingredients fresh. Nothing is more than day old once it is mix, and more often than not, it's less than a day old bc their salsas/guac are made every shift. Guacamole/avacado turns brown when exposed to air, so it needs to be made fresh to avoid that. I have always been extremely impressed with Chipotle's food, handling, and prep standards. Other restaurants should learn from them.
124149619252_10151058843154253:I don't know where this is, but you just made me really hungry for it!! And the closest one is Toronto, or NY, I guess if I'm desperate enough to go to another country... lol
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito w/ peppers and onions, cilantro rice, fresh tomato and corn salsa, cheese and sour cream. I order that every time.
124149619252_10153892196339253:I remember why I don't eat at Chipotle anymore BESIDES ecoli, your staff is rude and your rice is crunchy #getittogether
124149619252_10153792851004253:i was hoping with all this crap in the news i would encounter short lunch lines........not here damn you all
124149619252_10153246130479253:I just noticed the link says "Chipotle to stop serving genetically altered food," So any kind of genetically altered food is off the menu? For sure? Because this is what corn looked like before ancient Aztecs started genetically altering it.  http://www.livingcropmuseum.info/CropDetail/Corn%20Teosinte/Teosinte%20ear.jpg
124149619252_10150262089049253:@Trent We started on our own. McD didn't start us. They invested in us during our middle period only and then divested completely when we went public in 2006. @Gavin Oregano is in our meat marinade for three of our four meats, our pinto beans, our green tomatillo salsa, and our fajita vegetables. - Joe
124149619252_10152949800154253:Michael Murphy, we are sincerely sorry for this incident, but please know we did not refuse service to anyone. Hopefully this will shed some light on this a little: http://chip.tl/NYPDStatement -Skyllo
124149619252_10152560126959253:Bowl to go (easily 2 meals for me!) half white rice, black beans, chicken, extra corn salsa, tom salsa, lettuce, sour crm, cheese...side of guac and chips.  And ALWAYS a side of Dragon Salsa!
124149619252_122372141178171:and i thought my dvr wasn't recording the series! glad to know that i haven't missed anything with this series :)
124149619252_10152250518069253:Chipotle doesn't have competitors and if by "competitors" you mean Moe's or Q'doba then you're sadly mistaken. They don't use organic food or meats all of their meat is factory farmed and they both have queso which yes it tastes good but it's processed chemical filled cheese. Not natural at all. Nobody does what Chipotle does. There is no other restaurant even close to it. You don't understand Chipotle is the only restaurant that understands that people want fresh local produce and cage free animals. There are no competitors. Only imposters.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Eating mine now. Not too bad!if I were a vegetarian I would order this regularly. However, I do not prefer it over meat :)
124149619252_10150260442884253:If I had a little more notice, I totally would have been there - I was notified about a week too late to get a day off work to go meet Steve.
124149619252_10152108930454253:Thank you for caring about your employees and their families.I appreciate that!!!!! Not money hungry!!!!
124149619252_10151892810414253:Are we ever going to get our two free burritos for playing and then trying to move on to the next game?  I watched the video for the next game and nothing more would work.
124149619252_199537401806:I'll be one of the 1st people in Chipotle when they open in New Brunswick, NJ!  I want to win free burrito's! :)
124149619252_10152251259784253:Do only official jerseys count? I only have a LA Galaxy t-shirt. I'm too broke to afford an official one ):
124149619252_10152406485254253:Yeah because using female mannequins and the word "Mom" for target practice really demonstrates common sense and good judgment.   https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=890932557598837&id=100000463033030
124149619252_10152325977227741:You have just become the only restaurant I will frequent....  Congratulations Chipotle Mexican Grill on doing the right thing!
124149619252_279121798773401:I'm from Az, where we have 'real' Mexican food, and I love Chipotle. My family is stationed in Hawaii and we definately miss it.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito - light white rice, pintos, carnitas (but please. don't skimp!), medium salsa, light sour cream, cheese.
124149619252_10151086390274253:She needs to eat the Carnitas Burrito, Guac and Chips that we had at the N. St. Paul Store on Sunday, Delicious.
124149619252_10152853394299253:The Sauron should have DEFINITELY won in comparison to this. Congratulations to this person winning first place, but I don't feel this is well deserved.

124149619252_10151953860179253:Chipotle Mexican Grill is awesome, I love their chicken tacos and guac and lime chips, oh I am hungry just thinking about it!
124149619252_10153872104594253:Will always be a fan!  Still eating there!!   You guys make some of the best fast casual food, I drive an hour from Winona to Rochester, MN to get some two or three times a month.
124149619252_10152250518069253:So glad I didn't go in there expecting to be able to get a free lunch! I have received free meals at Chipotle in the past: on Halloween all we had to do was have something on our bodies made of foil and we received our meal for free.
124149619252_244957752262179:Ha, ha ironic that I am sitting in my Chipotle's parking lot eating a burrito and playing on my phone when this popped up!
124149619252_10152406485254253:Open carry policy at your stores???...yeah no burritos for me. Change your policies NOW...For now my kids and I will never go into a restaurant with a business run this way!
124149619252_10152560126959253:I think this needs to become an online quiz. True, I order a chicken burrito but I'm more adventurous than black beans and salsa. Amy- burrito, white, black, chicken, hot, corn, cheese and lettuce.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl, white rice, black beans, pico, medium, extra sour cream, lots of cheese, lettuce.  BOOM shaka laka BOOM !!!!
124149619252_10153047364704253:I just got THEE WORST BURRITO I'VE EVER HAD FROM ANYWHERE. IT WAS A TRULY PATHETIC CHIPOTLE BURRITO. CHECK MY PAGE FOR THE PIC. #????????????????
124149619252_10151089035244253:Every location in CBus! (Columbus Ohio) Favorite German Village. Coolest staff that serves it up right!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thank god a company is willing to finally invest more in their food, unlike almost all the other guys where I don't even know if you can call what they serve, food.. Hah.
124149619252_10150260445594253:Tricia and Patrick, we haven't changed any portioning standards anywhere or ever. If you aren't getting enough food, then just ask us for more. That's what's cool about getting your food made right in front of you. If we make a mistake, we'll fix it for you, if you let us know. Ask, and you shall receive. - Joe
124149619252_10151258924194253:Good for you Chipotle Management.  I hope you and your staff enjoy your Thanksgiving Day off!  I will see you Friday.  :)
124149619252_209217239092800:Come to the Hudso Ohio Chipotle when my LifeTeen group is there!! Its like watching a Shark Week feeding frenzy ON STEROIDS!!!
124149619252_156053474470:Lets make this happen all over thats the best idea I have heard in a long time. I would much rather pay a little extra for your food than have to get off my butt to go get it. Its a goldmine why didnt you do this earlier.AZ wants you to deliver the goods. PLEASSSSSSE!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken, extra Carnitas, white rice, no beans, hot sauce, medium corn salsa, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and a splash of honey chipotle vinaigrette!  Now that is UNBURRITABLE!!!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Bahahahhahahaha. You can't guarantee non-GMO. GMOs are out in the world breeding with non-GMOs. You can't stop life from happening.
124149619252_10151089035244253:The one where I fell in love with it- Pasadena/Deer Park, TX! the ones where I live (College Station, TX) are TOO small!
124149619252_10153872104594253:Te amo Chipotle I am not afraid of e coli ....barbacoa burrito wit avocado mmmmm the best food ever...... (^_*)
124149619252_10153132892604253:There must be crack in the guacamole. Yes. That explains its addictiveness. (Just teasing. I LOVE THE GUAC!)
124149619252_10153135670549253:Maybe I would if your portions were what they were when the store opened!  The continuous cutting of portions and price raising will eventually catch up to you Chipotle!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito: Brown rice, pinto beans, chicken with medium sauce, sour cream, cheese, corn/onion and alot of lettuce!  I could really go for one of those right now!  Mmmmmmmm....
124149619252_10152805746454253:Brown rice, black beans, medium or hot salsa, corn, lettuce and the chipotle vinaigrette on the side.
124149619252_10151024826814253:I am very high maintenance. Salad..beans to the side, half carnitas and chicken,some veges, mild salsa plus a little medium, corn, extra lettuce, no cheese, a teeny bit of sour cream and guacamole..although I hate paying extra for it. Then I squeeze lime all over it.
124149619252_10152407734029253:Not one latino writer?!  Whomever was in charge of this campaigne really made an egregious error indeed!  Incredible.
124149619252_10150959152619253:Not the one at the corner of McDowell & 7th Ave in Phoenix I hope, the service there sucked and the food was cold!
124149619252_100780796665922:I've only been to qudoba once and ot sucked and my burrito fell apart! Chipotle is 10 times better and I've never had my burrito fall open :-) 
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito Bowl - white rice, chicken, cheese, mild and corn salsa, no guac or sour cream. Put lid on, shake until well mixed. Open. Enjoy.
124149619252_10151486609219253:Brown rice, steak, corn salsa, fajita veggies, medium salsa.   Guac on the side.    And I get Bowl, not burrito.  Gotta save calories somewhere LOL
124149619252_10151719407409253:I found one of my college textbooks, which I used ~6 years ago.  I covered it with a paper Chipotle bag.  It had one of slogans for today's puzzle printed on it.    For all of the younger people, it is a very old school way to recycle a bag & protect a book cover.
124149619252_10150959152619253:not in Sebring, Florida... and we have a huge market for one! too bad I don't have the money for a franquise!
124149619252_10152307671269253:Whoever is in charge of Chipotle's advertising deserves a raise. From these ads to the little stories on the cups to the "Not a Winner" signs on the soda spouts that don't work, I am always cracking up. Well done! :)
124149619252_10153389325099253:I need yall to bring Chipotle to Germany. There are like 2 in whole country and theyre at airports ???? #ineedaburrito
124149619252_10153830182809253:Yess, please make a loyalty rewards program!!! Or at least a free burrito on my damn birthday... I contribute to you weekly, sometimes more than once...reward me for it with more food please ????
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito bowl: steak, pinto, lettuce, brown rice, sour cream, mild and medium salsas, guacamole, sour cream and cheese. awwww yeah
124149619252_10153246130479253:Soooo??? No corn, no beef, no pork.... What will you serve? Good luck finding wild foods in their unaltered state.
124149619252_147322035888:I LOVE IT!!!!!   and..." I LOVE CHIPOTLE!!!!   I love Chipotle so much my family thinks I'm a freak about it. lol   There is no Chipotle in my town "whaa!"  I ask everyone traveling through a nearby town to get me a few chipotle salads. When I travel we type in chipotle on the GPS and that is our route. I eat Chipotle all the way!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:You should add, "while supplies last." The Chipotle near me today "ran out of Sofritas," thus no free burrito on my next visit.
124149619252_209217239092800:Love Chipotle, working lunch at a Chipotle will give them a good look at running a busy store is like. I doubt they will be able to deal with it though. You have to work and think fast. Keep your team motivated and track multiple things at once. I just hope the regular patrons aren't let down, and these contestants don't disappoint Steve too badly. Don't underestimate how hard the people of Chipotle work. 
124149619252_10152883472094253:I really want Chipotle now that I just made a bowl to get my name... subliminal advertising works! LBVS
124149619252_10151086390274253:I was just saying today that you guys should be the food for the Olympics and not not not McDonald's!

124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie salad with black beans, fajita vegetables, all of the salsas, cheese with the yummy dressing & guac on the side (plus chips & hot salsa). Please open a 24 hour store! I'm craving chipotle now! :)
124149619252_10153438315219253:Happy Birthday Chipotle Mexican Grill! Thank you for doing away with the GMOs. We can only hope that others will follow in your footsteps!
124149619252_10153009001449253:I tried but the store by us was out of sofritas by 5PM. Not very good planning for national promotion.
124149619252_10151089035244253:Walden avenue in cheektowaga ny, safest place to eat at lunch time, every state trooper and Cheektowaga cop eats lunch there. Always a crowd of them at lunch time.  Best place I've had chipotle so far too.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Chipotle Mexican Grill:  How come headline says you've reached your goal of making all your food from non-GMO ingredients?  And in article, we read:  "Chipotles announcement does not mean that the restaurant will be entirely G.M.O.-free. The company acknowledges that some of the soft drinks it sells are likely to contain sweeteners made from G.M.O. corn, and that some of its meat and dairy supplies come from animals fed G.M.O. grains" ...  And today, sign in store as I walked in said, We've gone all NON-GMO" .... and I asked manager, who said as of May 1, everything is non-GMO...  Flawed signage, flawed info from manager, flawed info from you on your own fb page/marketing info to public.  Please respond.

124149619252_10152323527922741:Google "feeding the world in 2050" If it were up to the elitists at corporations like Chipotle, only the wealthy could afford meat, and the rest of the population... well, nature would take its course. We must use research and current technology to be able to feed an exploding population, using the same amount of land. It is not possible to feed the WORLD in 2050 using Chipotle's standards. Reality...do your homework.
124149619252_10153246130479253:I get sick every time I eat at Chipotle. I'm vegetarian; I try and get rice and beans, even that so called "sofrito" or whatever..  But I invariably get sick. The portions are not appropriate for smaller people, the food is way too greasy, and I don't know...  I cook rice and beans at home, but I never feel sick after eating my own food. So why? What do they put into it?
124149619252_10151024826814253:bowl, lime rice, peppers, onions, chicken, fresh salsa, hot salsa, cheese , sour cream...please send one ASAP!!!!
124149619252_185864848093833:Now if only more companys would do that then the corp's that own all the famrs would have to change their ways.. Its that easy...
124149619252_10151307314369253:I always appreciate that you guys honor your employees by giving them time off.  This crazy 24/7 lifestyle we have needs to be countered, and it's good to see such a popular restaurant doing that in small ways. Hope you all have a great holiday, and we'll look forward to tasty burritos when you come back.
124149619252_10152108930454253:Chipotle is so awesome. They seem like they treat their employees well. I would love to work there. They could just pay me in burritos.

Next time your store gets robbed and you have no choice but to put your hands up don't expect quick response we will assume you just like to hold your hands up high.....  First step for fixing this mess open scholarship fund for those kids that lost their fathers......... till than I can see taco bell employees hands on register waiting to take my order .....

124149619252_10153163816204253:Lol was just thinking I wonder why people don't just order their guac on the side always cause you get way more for what you pay for when u simply put it on the side than on the top or in the inside it's totally insane that at 1008 you have thinking guac sure sounds great!
124149619252_156053474470:They seriously need a Chipotle here in either Amarillo Texas or Canyon Texas. These people down here don't know what a awesome burrito is cuz they've never tasted one from Chipotle

124149619252_10153246130479253:So you have taken beef and sodas off your menu then?  Unless that has happened you are lying. Of course that isn't new to you. You once claimed to only feed grass fed beef and everyone knows that hasn't happened.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Can you please be open 24/7 I can't get enough. I work crazy hours so by the time I get off you are closed. Makes me sooo sad
124149619252_266206333465511:Yeah I've used chipotle foursquare check in multiple times and still don't have the groupie badge. Wtf
124149619252_10153001213604253:Thanks for being an ethical chain... I applaud you being a leader and doing what is right for your customers...
124149619252_194708182065:Wrong direction. Throw one of those down in Watertown/Fort Drum, NY. Military base! Come sell burritos and make lots and lots of cash.
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito w/ 1/2 serving brown rice, black beans, fajitas, a tiny bit of mild salsa, lots of corn, med. salsa, sour cream, cheese, guac, lots of lettuce.  Your medium salsa is the best in the world!!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Crescent Springs, KY on Buttermilk Pike. I've been to many chipotles and this one is the tastiest, cleanest, and has the best staff, hands down!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa burrito, brown rice, pinto beans, hot salsa, extra cheese, extra sour cream, lettuce. Still looking for my Chipotle soul mate!
124149619252_10153009001449253:I tried the sofritos when they had it going in a test market - delicious. So glad it will now be on all of their sites. Guacamole has always been free when I get vegetarian (bean) burrito bowl - will it be free with sofritos?
124149619252_199537401806:Salisbury, MD PLEASE!!!! http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/group.php?gid=184879810448&ref=ts  Join the group!!!
124149619252_10150260445594253:Everyone eats there without the punch card, so why would they give away free food if they didn't need to? Everybody is saying there are competitors all around but you still spend money at chipotle, well of course they aren't going to give you free food every 10th time,they don't need to to keep you coming back
124149619252_10153357673124253:^^its cause they found out their pork suppliers were not naturally raising their meat and were injecting hormones into their pigs , dont be mad at chipotle because they are sticking true to their business model unlike every other food chain that does whatever to try and keep up with demands at least with chipotle you know your getting quality food. Also carnitas is back in certian locations they are trying to condense it so that certain regions of the country get it and then rotate until they find new suppliers which is very hard to come by in this day and age
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl,chicken,lettuce,beans,brown rice,cheese,sour cream w/a tortilla on the side for a burrito with my leftovers
124149619252_508366689224451:When are you guys going to sponsor professional athletes who eat chipotle such as myself? I would be the best investment as a pro beach volleyball player
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl with light rice, black beans, veggies, tomato salsa, green salsa, cheese, and extra sour cream and of course I have to have chips and guac :)
124149619252_10151089035244253:Sioux Falls SD!  Oh wait... no we don't have one :(  one of the best economies in the US and we don't have one. Omaha has them. The twin cities have them but us between: nope :(   Please bring us a Chipotle!!!!!
124149619252_10153270305244253:Love your food.  No.  LOVE your food, but not happy lately that the portions are getting smaller but the price stays the same.  In every Massachusetts one I have visited on the rt 95 belt line.   Why?
124149619252_10153302468484253:Took family for supper yesterday for first time ever at Chipotle and only because you all went GMO free! Thanks so much! It was wonderful and the guacamole was best I ever ate.  Brown rice was awesome too with all that cilantro (I love cilantro). We will be regular customers from now on!
124149619252_115365598544868:should be called a rice burrito with a tiny bit of meat! Oh and the one i go to they can never wrap the dam burrito so they end up trying to wrap it then can't so they get another tort and pour the stuff from the last burrito into the new tort. Not realizing that all my sauce and sour cream is in the last tort. And i'm charged 7 bucks for that? Ya i'm for qdoba now
124149619252_10153246130479253:So surprised to see all the negative comments. However, most people are completely unaware and uneducated about our food. They are unaware of exactly what a GMO is and what else is used to process our food. This is all new to most Americans. Don't even waste the time arguing with what most people say or think, because in due time they will know and understand it all. Only the people who educated themselves regarding our food supply, where are food came from, and what it took to produce it, can truly understand Chipotle's (and other non GMO food establishments) integrity.
124149619252_10153720921419253:Is chipotle doing the holiday gift card promotion this year?  Free burrito if you buy $25 gc was last year
124149619252_10153543212484253:Just payed 12 dollars for a burrito then received the wrong one when paying.. Then when they made the next one it was literally half the size so that they would lose money on my order.. Completely disappointed..
124149619252_240071849428248:Once again ... I would love for Chipolte to open a grill in Shreveport / Bossier La. area PLEASE !!!!
124149619252_10151258924194253:I vote you guys make a Thanksgiving Burrito next year for the month of November. Turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce. Yeah. Please do it. Like if you agree.
124149619252_10153236016399253:Dear chipotle,  It's cool that you do delivery now but honestly, driving to chipotle has never been my problem. If anything needs to be changed its your hours. I need you to be open 24/7. Trust me... If you're open they will come.   Yours truly, Samuel Perez
124149619252_10153547799644253:Love Chipotle Mexican Grill but hate money hungry lawyers and whiny consumers. I try to stay away from GMOs also, but wow, just wow! People need to get a life! At least Chipotle is trying to do the right thing! That's more than I can say for most chains!
124149619252_10153656854824253:I didn't like guacamole until one of my KMs made me try his, now I get at least 2 portions every meal. RIP C7
124149619252_205082546217004:Wow, McDonalds at the top of its list, and Chipotle and Panera Bread at the top of theirs.  All of these restaurants are owned by McDonalds.  That's some good marketing, right there.
124149619252_492523374093310:Hang in there I know what you mean. I try to take it one step at a time. But I keep falling of the wagon everyday as well. Lol
124149619252_10153246130479253:So apparently Chipotle is censoring a word rhyming with "shmoycott" from their page.   Un-scientific, and afraid of dissenting opinion. I won't be eating here anymore.
124149619252_10152177306959253:I love this actor he played the perfect devil in reaper. If not for that show i don't think I'd know him
124149619252_105860719543628:Congrats! I've been holding up my end of the bargain and giving you some pretty great word of mouth for years :)
124149619252_10153214785299253:It's free entry. 5 dollars to park. 2 dollar drink samples 6 dollar full cocktails. 2-7 dollars for food :D hope that helps
124149619252_10151427891034253:that smile is not fake I know it for sure just the picture was taken at a strange time you all know you saw one of your selves  in the same predicament great work out there everyone
124149619252_266206333465511:I don't get badges for companies who denounce conventional commercial farming practices, which feed the world!
124149619252_10153872104594253:Chipotle Mexican grill I didn't claim my burrito when I click the link it said I did when I didn't help please
124149619252_10151520750889253:"...no matter what you may be observing."  Thank you for remembering that not everyone celebrates Easter.  Chag Sameach!
124149619252_10152805746454253:Aw hell yeah: Steak, veggies, cilantro rice, mild, lettuce, Pico, corn, sour cream, cheese, and if I can afford it some guacamole (:
124149619252_10152407734029253:Thank you for your commitment to our youth. Our local Chipotle has donated thousands of dollars to our schools this year. You are a great corporate neighbor. As such, I hope you'll reconsider allowing open carry in your restaurants. Moms thank you!
124149619252_10153395310879253:Chipotle Mexican Grill Thank you for taking stands on human issues and not being a shrinking violet hoping to please everyone. I will be enjoying some Chipotle goodness if not today, tomorrow for sure. :)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Ckn fajita burrito with white rice, light black beans, fajita onions & peppers, hot sauce, mild sauce, lots of corn, sour cream. Love the guac on the side. 
124149619252_10152314382492741:I wont eat pork again but I commend any farmer that raises their animals in this manner whether it is cows or pigs. We need to go back in time and allow these animals to roam and be free,even if they are ultimately consumed. The bottom line is it is healthier for them and the consumer! NO MORE GMO corn fed as it is harming us humans!!!
124149619252_492523374093310:I'm Sooooo addicted.....I used to eat there @ least 3 time a week,however I notice a change in my waist line so I cut back to one a week or anytime I see one.............CHIPOTLE ROCKS!!!!!!!
124149619252_196891642078:Deliciious. Today it would be craving because I am 9 mo. pregnant and would beat someone up for their chipolte carnitas burrito, but I live hours away from a chipolte. :(
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl, white rice, barbacoa and carnitas half and half, corn and mild salsa, extra sour cream, extra cheese, and two orders of chips and guac.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito with: chicken, brown rice, black beans, onions n bell peppers, extra pico, mild salsa, cheese, and sour cream.  Plus a little bit of smoked tobasco.  Delicious!
124149619252_10153438315219253:Is there a reason why you guys raised the price of quesaritos 3 bucks ?  Come on  Just paid 16 bucks for one meal
124149619252_10153009001449253:Went to one location they were out then went to another and was told you only have until Wednesday January 28th to come back for your free one but all the advertisements including Facebook and the the receipt say February 28th....?????
124149619252_10151089035244253:The original in denver..jus went there today w/ Zach Souder n Mariah Marie Souder was the best burrito ive eva had
124149619252_109031815838831:Chipotle Restaurant....u need to put more meat than rice on ur burritos. I dont want a rice burrito. 
124149619252_10152004082504253:Lorem Ipsum is common in the Graphic Design/ Publishing world. It's filler-text used usually for designs in which the content that will go on it is still pending! I love using it :D
124149619252_10151089035244253:The Lewisville, Texas 121 location has the perfect amount of cilantro in the rice...everything time. And cant forget the first Chipotle that started it all for me: Frisco, Texas
124149619252_100780796665922:I love both!  At Chipotle I get a chicken burrito.  At QDoba I get ground beef.  :D  Way back when, I used to go to the QDoba in Boulder when it was ZTeca.  They had to change their name in order to expand outside of Colorado since there were restaurants already called ZTeca.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Great site to find Non GMO food and get the facts straight.  http://www.nongmoproject.org/about-gmos-2/
124149619252_10150719072154253:So because people still believe that a guy who never existed magically came back from the dead 2000 years ago, we don't get to have Chipotle? What a rip-off!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Good luck! ???????????? Everything is a GMO now! This is just a good excuse to jack up the prices, fill your CEO's pockets, and get praised by it by the public! Kudos Chipotle. You've figured it all out.
124149619252_164816057005566:NOM! In LA., PLEEEEEEEASE! ...and this time, keep the veggie meat option even if it's not as popular. Those of us who'd rather eat veg may not be as large a percentage of the population, but gee it's great to have a place to EAT!
124149619252_10152949800154253:Cmon people, Chiptole will never endorse of that kind of stuff. When employees do things like that? They represent the company but the employee represented in bad name. It example on why people should leave their opinions and views at home not at a workplace.
124149619252_145246312263952:Don't waste your time or money at Chipolte.  My tacos and burritos are waaaayyy better.  Ask anyone at Cheviot Sports Tavern.
124149619252_520689341285681:We need this option in Chicago!  Love the brown rice, having a soy or other meatfree protein option would be perfection!
124149619252_10151486609219253:Brown rice, pinto beans, fajita, steak, mild salsa, medium salsa, hot salsa, cheese, extra sour cream & guac. No lettuce.
124149619252_10151024826814253:soft tacos, carnitas, little chees and lettuce.  my go to at chipotle about 2 times a week.  big fan!
124149619252_10153693560944253:I like your food, but I wish you would stop with the "anti-GMO" and certified organic rhetoric. It's misleading to low information consumers who don't actually understand how limited the risks associated with these technologies are.
124149619252_10153001213604253:You PETA types are classic......they're still killing chickens and cows, nit-wits........mmmmm, think I'll go eat me some pork right now! ha ha.
124149619252_10151024826814253:I'll take an everything, can I get a bottle of chipoltaway also I'm gunna need it. Wife's getting mad about the blood 
124149619252_10153246130479253:One of the only "fast food" restaurants that takes pride in their ingredients and that I am proud to go to!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thanks Chipotle for using more expensive ingredients and destroying my wallet, and your investors profit margins.
124149619252_10151089035244253:My local N. Canton, Ohio Chipotle is going downhill. The new hires are chintzy with the food. I don't go much anymore even though I love the food.
124149619252_10152786808474253:Makes me want to try different combinations.  Yeah right!!  Healthy version salad bowl, brown rice, black bean, chicken, all salsas and cheese.  Eat anything I want burrito, white rice, pinto beans
124149619252_10153009001449253:The sofritas is really good, surprisingly.  It has the consistency of ground meat and the seasoning is great.  You really wont miss not having meat.  Try it.  I get mine with both beans, all of the veggies brown rice and sour cream and the dressing on the side.  It is Oh, so good.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thanks for settling the debate for me: Qdoba FTW.  If Chipotle wishes to exploit fear for profit, I will no longer eat at their establishments.
124149619252_10151089035244253:I love this place! But the nearest one to me is 300 miles away. Please open one in the Jackson, Miss area!
124149619252_10152250518069253:I do not believe this response to an obviously fake offer circulating is coming off the way you wanted.  It's worth noting that I was a longtime and frequent customer at the Annapolis location and would frequently get a card for a free burrito or they would throw in my chips for free.  I was always polite and friendly with the staff.  I never expected anything for free and was always very appreciative of the offers.    It was enough to say that the offer was fake without suggesting that you guys NEVER do anything for free for your customers.  A lot of people seem pretty hung up on that.
124149619252_197492226983965:Have my friends @ Chipotle considered doing this in different cities?? Like a Chipotle tour??**hint hint**
124149619252_10152407734029253:..says the so called patriot with a cartoon drawing for a avatar picture. No, you are ugly. And not a patriot either. I served in the air force for 10 years w honorable discharge while you troll facebook.  I'm so wounded by your empty words. Truly.
124149619252_209217239092800:richard's english is fine and he got his education but looks like your face needs some major work. and yur a little old 2 start drama. smh.  
124149619252_10150959152619253:Definitely nowhere in Puerto Rico! Please add a retaurant here! everytime i go to the states I stuff myself with burritos!
124149619252_10153270305244253:We just did an hour ago... The new Chipotle on Riverside rocks! The employees are so nice and awesome ! ????????????
124149619252_10151024826814253:Salad: Double chicken, extra green peppers/onions, pico, extra spicy salsa, a little cheese, and a small dollop of sour cream.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Streak burrito = rice, streak extra steak, cheese. all served by the awesome chipotle staff in middleton wi
124149619252_10150262089049253:Despite the price increase, it is still well worth it. Whatever you chipotle pepper people do, it still tastes gourmet.
124149619252_10152108930454253:Can you work on opening at anytime in Pensacola, Florida? There are thousands of people here craving Chipotle.
124149619252_10151839071994253:When we were living in Germany, we had no good options for Tex Mex. Instead we made our own. The Germans in Frankfurt should all get out and try this!
124149619252_10150719072154253:happy for all the hard workers:-) may they spend a blessed day with family and friends! Bridgwater,NJ location.
124149619252_163198123842255:I'm a meat eater. But after reading the nice story of free loving pigs I feel bad now for these little creatures :( maybe I will go vegan but chipotle is tasty!
124149619252_261338423981855:COME TO KINGSTON, TN!!!  they are building a new hospital and medical offices by the TVA plant...can you imagine all the medical workers, hospital employees, TVA ppl who could eat there!!! and the only place to eat for  miles is a crappy little subway that is always PACKED seriously!! has 5 seats...HURRY before someone else comes and takes the good spot!!!!
124149619252_166838126748689:we first ate at a Chipotle Mexican Grill in CA, we were so impressed with the "idea" of the business, etc, we bought stock the next day!! LOOOOOVE it!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl, brown rice, black beans, corn, pico, hot salsa, light amount of sour cream, light amount of cheese, extra lettuce.
124149619252_10153246130479253:THANK YOU for helping make our country safer!!! Now we just need to remove Glyphosate (Round-up) from non-GMO grains and other items. Organic is the way to go and you can do it!!! You are leading the way!!!
124149619252_10153460358024253:Is Chipotle GMO Free....I know El Dorado Cantina in Las Vegas is GMO Free....Looking for a good place to eat in this area that is GMO Free....
124149619252_135356053201187:Love it bought your stock at $53 dollars a share now it's around $240 a share me like it a lot $$$$$$
124149619252_10151185000424253:To the people who think they wouldn't break even if they made it free:  I agree $2 is still a great deal; however, they would certainly break even from all the people who would still buy drinks, chips, guacamole... So it's unnecessary for it to have a price to break even.
124149619252_10151024826814253:i love everything at chipotle  but if i had a favorite.. burrito with steak, peppers, lots of rice, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, corn salsa,  little more cheese  with chips and tomato salsa as a side!!!! YUMMY!!!
124149619252_10152250518069253:It's not a bad idea, though. Perhaps you should start such a promotion. Not the full meal free, of course...
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl with white rice, black beans, chicken, 3 scoops of the hot salsa, corn, cheese, only a little lettuce, sour cream on the side, & another scoop of hot on the side! & a Coca cola!!! I could eat it EVERY SINGLE DAY!!!
124149619252_156053474470:That would make my day. The resturants are small and can be crowded, now I can enjoy from the comfort of my home!!!!
124149619252_10151587164929253:Thanks for labeling and then getting rid of nasty GMOs that are toxic and bad for us and are not "substantially equivalent".  We all love you for this.
124149619252_10153780999604253:"The same lobbyist who argued that Cuomo's $15 fast-food wage unfairly empowers people with "no experience or skills" has found an even bigger source of outrage: Chipotle. The Center for Consumer Freedom, as Richard "Dr. Evil" Berman's group is called, has decided it is vehemently anti-Chipotle because the chain gave up GMOs and antibiotics and feeds people burritos that, if eaten in excess, could make them gain weight. The Chubby Chipotle campaign started with the two Post ads up above, likely inspired by the truth about Chipotle's crazy-high calorie counts.  Yesterday evening, it grew to include a Washington Times Commentary piece by Berman himself explaining his group's "public education campaign." He slams the chain for "ignoring science" and "creating profits while providing angst for consumers"  definitely penetrating words from the guy Big Liquor pays to lobby for less-strict drunk-driving laws.  Chipotle-mania has been getting a little tepid lately, but Berman's attacks have given everyone from the Humane Society to the Food Babe a reason to defend the carnitas purveyor again. "Berman and CCF have refused to say who is funding this campaign, but they almost certainly are factory farming interests" who dislike Chipotle "because it chooses not to sell meat from animals jammed into cages or loaded up with antibiotics," says the Humane Society in a statement. "So much for his defense of the free market."  CCF claims to have, or have had, thousands of donors, including Monsanto, Wendy's, and Tyson Foods, almost all of whom stand to benefit by smearing Chipotle. The group refuses to reveal who's funded the anti-Chipotle campaign, though."  http://www.grubstreet.com/2015/09/chipotle-fat-shaming.html  #CorporateSabotage
124149619252_10152935096524253:Please, please, please open a Chipotle in Anchorage, Alaska. The population here LOVES fresh Mexican food, and Qdoba just keeps getting worse and worse here. We do have a lot of local restaurants, and they are ALWAYS packed. Chains that open here typically claim that their Alaska stores do better than anywhere else. Check the numbers. We're waiting!!
124149619252_10151486609219253:Not much chicken!!!!! They pretty much give you 5 pieces and a WHOLE LOT of rice. I miss the old chipotle :-(
124149619252_10151024826814253:"Burrito: Rice, no beans, chicken. *Lettuce first, cheese second (so the cheese doesn't melt right away). Sour cream and guac on the side so that I can put the perfect proportion for each bite." :D 
124149619252_10153530958859253:Shuntay Harper Emily Thompson  Our residents would still be complaining never they would be this happy well May be Polly ????
124149619252_10153246130479253:"We've achieved our goal of making all of the food at our US restaurants with only non-GMO ingredients.".... this is not true... there are itmes on the menu which still contain gm ingredients. FULL disclosure or retract your claim!
124149619252_10152693491999253:Chipotle rocks! I see a couple of negative comments but there will always be haters who thrive on hate.
124149619252_10153395310879253:My lunch today will be Chipotle!                                                         It is so ordered.
124149619252_10151024826814253:bowl, one scoop of white rice, pinto beans, chicken (sometimes extra), sour cream, lett, and cheese and chips to go with it!
124149619252_10151024826814253:I love those stupid lime chips! I wish they were freshly fried though, instead of waiting in a bag. (also, chicken burrito, black beans, lime rice, corn salsa, sour cream)
124149619252_10153844182544253:Love Chipotle! The ones by me have always been clean. Never had a bad meal! It is all about how each individual location is run. Unfortunately, some workers are only there for the paycheck and don't care one way or another about how they handle the food. Which can be said for every restaurant out there. I'm not giving up on Chipotle.
124149619252_10151307314369253:good for you guys!!!  where i work closes too!  merry chrismas to you all and thanks, since my son works for this awesome company!!!
124149619252_10153569576059253:I use to love chipotle chicken, until I went to a brand new one and was given cold Chicken >_<  who maintains holding temps? no one at the new Las Vegas location. That's for sure
124149619252_10151892810414253:Farm team players - you have to sign up, then play and get to or beyond the first level, and then you will get notification for your free t-shirt or burrito.
124149619252_10153001213604253:Pull the pork off but the beef and chicken is raised same way so pull that off to and put dog on the menu
124149619252_10152925087634253:Ana Espinosa Nelly Perez Nayarith Selles Alexandra Alvarez Glory Quintero Luis Valeriano yeiiiii ????????????
124149619252_10151024826814253:Name the ingredients, only so I don't forget something yummy! I like the Chicken Burrito Bowl with a side of chips for dipping...Guac and SC
124149619252_193042867405266:All I can think of is Ron Reagan Jr. wrapping a banana back in a '87-'88 PSA video. Talk about wrapping up what you love... :)
124149619252_10153009001449253:I don't think I will ever eat at Chipolte ever again. I ate there once. And will not support them anymore. People need to get facts on farming talk to a farmer. Meet a farmer and talk to a farmer and understand modern agriculture.
124149619252_279121798773401:Dear McDonald's" Even though you bought Chipotle, I want to thank you for keeping your McPaws off of them and letting them keep their flavour and their own look. And thanks for letting them use pork from the smaller farms that don't use those anti-bios and stuff. (You do still do that, yeah?)
124149619252_10150260445594253:so funny that this entire convo has nothing to do with the pic of the infamous big man in the bow tie!  lol  could have just put a pic of a big burrito (in a bow tie?) there instead  :)
124149619252_454413931302356:well the kkk and the boy scouts are both bullies and both refuse to move forward so they have correlations as for being christian you can start be be a better one and open your arms to other people rather than keeping it the family "no oun intended"
124149619252_10151024826814253:Sometimes I get the vegetarian bowl even tho I'm not a vegetarian. I like living on the edge. Free guac doesn't hurt either.
124149619252_185864848093833:The point is "BUY MEAT" without antibiotics! That's why you can EAT MEAT at Chipolties they use meat with NO antibiotics! You don't have to go VEGAN. Start demanding it at all of the grocery store. Don't purchase milk with antibiotics either! Do your research!
124149619252_10153001213604253:Great job standing up for the humane treatment of animals before human consumption!! Need more establishments doing this!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Yesterday I had a bowl with brown rice, both beans, chicken, corn, pico de gallo and lots of lettuce -- Weight Watcher friendly!
124149619252_10153806089609253:Regarding the lawsuit against you guys, I personally suspect your food was deliberately sabotaged by some inside agent of some company like Monsanto, due to your openly anti-GMO, pro-organic stance.
124149619252_10152805746454253:White rice, pinto beans, fajita veggies, double chicken, hot and corn salsa, and cheese ????????????????????????????????????
124149619252_10151809543439253:Mouth watering at gorditas con queso fresco. Definitely need to add some cilantro with that, though! : D
124149619252_454413931302356:If Chipotle doesn't support kids doing good for our community then lets not do anything good for them. Take your dollar else where.
124149619252_10151267410249253:If you are reading this and are in need of making extra cash or would like to work from home all you would need to qualify is a working computer, long distance phones, and knowledge of cut and paste in Microsoft word additional training is provided for you. So if there are serious about working from home please message me and I would give you additional information.
124149619252_156053474470:Truly diving intervention played a role here... anyone hiring PTs in Columbus.... any chance you have a chipotle plan as a benefit I can enroll in?
124149619252_10152949800154253:Just to note, chipotle is not supporting  whatever this kid thought he was doing when he copied what some people are doing in the news.  They said in their letter his actions were not consistent with their corp culture.  They tried to distance themselves from his actions but did so poorly.  There are other motives for being mum on his job status. They should have hired PR firm to handle it from the get go.
124149619252_10153246130479253:That's so awesome! Yay!! Go Chipotle! ???? Jilina Jeanne Scott  Why does is have to make me sick every time though?! Why stomach? Why!!!???
124149619252_10152840149194253:The fact that I just finished eating one of their burritos makes this post just that much more comforting! haha
124149619252_122372141178171:Jamie is amazing! He's not looking to put anyone out of business - he's looking to make standard everyday food more healthy! There's no reason why Taco Bell should be allowed to serve a "Beef" burrito that's really made with only a 20% "beef byproduct"! And kids should be drinking regular milk - not chocolate milk at lunch! It's ridiculous!
124149619252_10151024826814253:White rice, black beans, barbacoa( sometimes +steak) tomatoes, sour cream, cheese, extra guac. Mmmmmm.
124149619252_10153903490999253:Over priced and e coli'"!,,,&especially not Mexican food u are being trick believing it is mexican food ,,,,,,itS upgrade to TACO BELL !!! NASTY
124149619252_10153088156639253:Sean Ludolph Lydia Ludolph i hate chipotle simply cuz i haven't had it before, but ill be 21 when this comes to Minneapolis so we should totally go
124149619252_10152407734029253:Not ONE Latino in this "thoughtful" campaign.  www.mediaite.com/online/oops-chipotle-forgot-to-include-latino-writers-in-its-literary-cup-campaign/
124149619252_10151520750889253:I commend you for closing for the Easter holiday...May you and all your employees have a wonderful day with your families!  :)
124149619252_205082546217004:I had Chipotle for breakfast lol! They are the best cause you are the best Joe! That's why you my Boo ; ) Heeeeey.....
124149619252_10153163816204253:Good one Joe ^_^ I like it, you know ^_^ but I have to agree, with Amy, you see - A station for changing, and cleaning and such, would give new mommies and daddies much glee ^_^
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Burrito Bowl with a tortilla in it, pinto beans, tomatoes, Extra corn, Extra Sour Cream, Extra Cheese and lettuce and chips. Haven't used a fork in 2 years. Finish the whole thing with chips
124149619252_10152250518069253:Can I apologize on behalf of the internet for all your employees that will be yelled at because of that picture?
124149619252_279121798773401:I love Chipotle especially their soft veggie tacos with a side of chips and guac.. BUT I have always felt their chips leave a lot to be desired.. they are weird
124149619252_10151486609219253:Was just at chipotle a little bit ago... Brown rice, pinto beans, 1/2 chicken 1/2 steak, al 3 salsas, lots of corn, cheese, lettuce, then mix it all up and top with smoked hot sauce!
124149619252_10152250518069253:I went with my children. We ordered & when it was time to pay we showed the cashier the promo, all of us had downloaded it to our phones. At that time we were told that that the promo was a fake; needless to say we were embarrassed & pretty pissed. There was not sign posted but 'they knew about the hoax'... We could have been offered a discount by management & your establishment could have come out looking like a rock star! Instead you look like some cheap & unsympathetic "Joe"... Called the local TV station so you can get some positive press locally here in Raleigh... "no such thing as a free lunch" huh? How about no such thing as bad press?
124149619252_10152925087634253:Thank you for giving your hard working employees time off for Christmas, just another reason I love Chipotle!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Kathryn Curtiss..... its not true. Just sharing with you since you posted it on your page. Didnt want you to try it and get some crazy looks. Haha
124149619252_10152786808474253:Chipotle was packed the other night so my husband got me hot head burrito and I was not impressed with it at all. I just want chipotle ='[
124149619252_10151307314369253:Good! Christmas should be spend with family....not the crabby general public working! Merry Christmas Joe!!!!
124149619252_10152883504929253:Chipotle Mexican Grill could you make a cheese dip for the chips? A few of us in my family are allergic to /dislike guacamole and salsa. Just a thought! Otherwise I'll just keep eating the chips plain lol they are amazing.
124149619252_10153489422339253:Ever since a large family of aphids were found crawling around my salad I stopped eating at Chipotle years ago.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Lol while cows n chickens are still eating that gmo... oh well gmo isn't bad! Except for the planet i.e. 7 billion people thanks to gmo.
124149619252_10152250518069253:To all the winers who fell for it, the post about the free lunch did not get posted by Chipotle so it should have been a red flag. Duh! Stop wining!   Joe, chipotle still rocks! Keep making those delicious burritos.
124149619252_10152949800154253:Bravo again, Chipotle! Glad you guys not only make /great/ food, you make great choices that benefit your employees. Happy New Year!!
124149619252_10153643599234253:When can we get a Chipotle in the Conyers, Covington, Decatur, Lithonia, Stone Mountain Georgia area? I live in Covington Georgia,  and the nearest Chipotle is 40 miles away in Snellville.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I'm pretty sure I need to try a barbacoa burrito & get one free the next time, not sofritas. I'll pass.
124149619252_10151024826814253:4 soft tacos with white rice, carnitas, lettuce, sour cream and cheese   ( sometimes guacamole- if thats how you spell it )
124149619252_10153009001449253:I'm vegetarian and the sofritas are OK, but I prefer just the black beans, cilantro-lime rice & guacamole. It would be really awesome if you could offer some Daiya cheese & also some non-dairy sour cream!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Hi Joe ... Alexandria used to be our favorite but there are new people there that aren't as good as the old ones ..... Right Crystal Groves ?
124149619252_10153236016399253:They should include "chronically busy" in their title because some of us are and delivery is the only option. Either way, its a win!
124149619252_10151058843154253:Special because all chicken served here is actually random birds killed by the wind turbine on the roof...No food going to waste is good earth stewardship.
124149619252_10153020304519253:Sorry chipotle. Without pork, we cannot sustain a relationship. I will miss your rice also. Fortunately, I live in the south and can't throw a rock without hitting a bbq pork restaurant.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl: brown rice, steak (or chicken), fajita, mild salsa and cheese! Low on the calories and YUMMY for the tummy!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Oh yes of course! Chicken burrito bowl pinto beans, rice, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, hot sauce! And Guacamole! :-)
124149619252_10151086390274253:Are you still eating burritos and the like in your last stage of pregnancy?  It would have finished me off - more power to you.
124149619252_155304234532263:I think I'm going to stick with not wrapping anything in gold foil. It seems rather pointless and wasteful to me. But I do want a Chipotle burrito now...
124149619252_10153555173409253:Have you fixed your made up carnitas "problem"?  If not I don't care.  I can't taste "responsibly raised" so just give me some freaking pork.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito: Rice, extra chicken, corn, tomatoes, cheese, extra sour cream, guacamole and lettuce!
124149619252_105860719543628:This was the most beautiful commercial I've ever seen on tv.  Thank you for making it and getting it on the air!
124149619252_261338423981855:I love you guys. So much. The Orlando-UCF location is always generous and awesome and delicious. Thank you for feeding me yummy things! 
124149619252_365284166822162:Sorry - Michelle, no bowls, and Tim, no substitutions. Please read one of the Burritos By The Box forms when you have time and thank you. - Joe
124149619252_10151658877254253:Chipotle isn't GMO free. They have merely promised to disclose what ingredients they use are GMO. BIG difference and not enough for this consumer. It's at least a start but it seems something that should have been done all along.
124149619252_10153009001449253:It would have been great if your Sanford location had of chosen to participate in this! What was the point of advertising this if all restaurant locations does not  have any Sofritas in stock? Why advertise this and not plan ahead to have Sofritas in the restaurant that day? This is very disappointing!
124149619252_10152407734029253:Where are the Mexican/Mexican American authors???  You really dropped the ball here, Chipotle. Who compiled this list? We would be happy to provide you with a list of Mexican/Mexican American authors to get you started, just say the word.
124149619252_10152996855759253:Thank you for being the best burrito restaurant ever ... and holding the farmers/vendors accountable to maintain high food standards. I wish more companies followed your lead. You will always have our business. Thanks
124149619252_10152693491999253:Carlos we grew up eating them back then but they weren't made the same as they are now! Now theyre literally killing people
124149619252_10152949800154253:Ryan, we're sorry to hear that and we hope this might help, at least a little: http://chip.tl/NYPDStatement -Skyllo
124149619252_454413931302356:Chipotle, Stay out of my bedroom! You, like the scouts have the right to choses what you support, but I will NEVER eat at a Chipotle again!
124149619252_10153253574299253:Sweet Baby Jesus. Corinne, ToriBird, Steph... Bask in the glory. Those tacos appear to be made with carnitas. Oh, how my heart, and mouth, yearn for the taste of delicious carnitas. My pregnancy craving for a carnita bowl is one that I simply cannot fulfill until PA gets carnitas back. When that sacred day arrives, will you three share in the joy with me?
124149619252_322643590240:Their catering is awesome! Try it some time for a healthy alternative for a group gathering. They supply EVERYTHING!
124149619252_134085872963:Ok, so anyone that lives in HARRISON?  They are putting in a Chipotle over by Home Depot..  OMG I am soooo excited over the smallest of things...  I can't wait...  LOL
124149619252_10153246130479253:That is all good but don't pass the price difference to the consumer.  Just take it from the profits you are making.
124149619252_10153246130479253:So no more food, basically? Since everything we eat has been genetically modified either by years of artificial selection or transgenics or both? Super excited that this leading food chain has taken a scientifically-sound stance on nutrition with tons of research to back up the deleterious health effects of all genetically altered food. Also super excited to pay $8 for a burrito with nothing in it.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito, brown rice, pinto beans, extra cheese, hot sauce, sour cream, guacamole, and lettuce. Also can't forget the smoked tabasco sauce :)
124149619252_10151258924194253:I just screamed "Noooooo!!!!" At the top of my lungs in my office. A tear of sadness slips down my warm cheek as all this sinks in. :*(
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito with barbacoa, rice, black beans, cheese, sour cream, caramelized onions, cilantro and hot sauce.   Didn't know you could do a double wrap. I'll have to try that
124149619252_10152927494854253:Please build one in hinesville. You would get so much business near fort Stewart. I don't have enough time to drive an hour away to go to the closest one. Please!!? It will be worth it
124149619252_10152881174584253:Sorry, 14 bucks a person for food alone is more than if I just bought everyone their own burrito and drink a la cart.
124149619252_10151486609219253:I have Chipotle TWICE a week. I have tried to make my own rice bowls at home, but it's just not the same.  Rice bowl; vegetarian, white rice, black beans, fajita veggies, extra mild, medium, corn, sour cream, cheese and guacamole.  YUMMMMM!
124149619252_10153112208029253:No,  but you may suggest sofritas with black beans,  peppers,  onions,  pico de Gallo,  corn salsa,  and lettuce.  :-)  #plantpowered
124149619252_10152992584389253:No thanks.  I prefer to eat 'real' Mexican food at 'real' Mexican restaurants.  None of this fake 'Chi Chi's' stuff.  BTW - How do you have an authentic Southeast Asian Kitchen without pork?  Just sayin'.
124149619252_10153236016399253:Shaunielle Street- we go there so much.... Lol. Howard students order it like it is going out of style :-)
124149619252_10151024826814253:White cilantro lime rice, chicken, fajita vegetables, mild tomato salsa, roasted chili corn salsa and guacamole.
124149619252_156053474470:South Florida wants deliveries too! I'm craving for a burrito right now, but unfortunately can't drive 20 minutes to the closest Chipotle
124149619252_199537401806:South Carolina????  I would love to be able to get Chipotle when I go to North Myrtle Beach every year!!!!!
124149619252_135356053201187:Ok, whitney....what chipotle is opperating like that? Because federal laws say they cannot do that. Now, if they have a franchise that is family owned and run, it maybe that they have all family working there, which is different, but if it isn't and a manager isn't hiring you because of the color of your skin, you call corporate offices and if they do nothing, get a lawyer. 
124149619252_10151058843154253:They are doing a lot of that down here in Houston.  The city wants to stay on top as the greenest city.  I love some Chipotle and Chick-Fil-A.  Two best fast food joints around.
124149619252_10151058843154253:Chipotle Burrito is what I eat the most whenever I visit US. I almost live on it when I am there.. love it.. :-)
124149619252_10153395310879253:Dont ruin chipotle for me please...i had some yesterday. But yeah...i respect your freedom of speech to support this even though im 100% opposed.
124149619252_10150163730979253:i am SO making my brother and sister in law wrap their first child up like chipotle to bring it home from the hospital whenever they start expanding the family :)
124149619252_10152715839394253:Tacos with lettuce cheese mild and corn, OR in a bowl with corn mild rice cheese black beans sour cream BUT no matter what I get chips and guacamole are a MUST
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito: lime rice and black beans, barbacoa, lettuce, cheese, mild sauce, and some guac to top it off !! <3
124149619252_221129944611968:tO gOOD fOR wORDS..............My Husband and I are making it a Habit on Sunday Afternoons!!!Great Food, Service,Music(if you don't  do take-out)and they serve Negra (Beer)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Oh yeah!  Ok, Veggie Salad, for SURE! No dressing, half scoop br rice, veggies, heavy bl beans, tom and corn salsa, cheese and heavy on the guacamole!  Hallelujah!!!!
124149619252_221129944611968:can you guys make a chipotle sour cream? i love your sour cream now, but i think youd get a lot of takers on the chipotle sour cream
124149619252_135356053201187:Why isn't there a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Phoenix, Arizona? Like around 59th Ave and Indian School. Love the food, but I'm not going to drive to Tempe to get it.
124149619252_199537401806:PLEASE come to Mississippi!! There's not much here- so we could definitely use some burritos to brighten our day!! =)
124149619252_10153240834269253:Chipotle has given in to fear mongering antiscience whackjobs. Way to go chipotle for helping set us back scientifically. You appreciate cultivating thought? Haha that's a laugh from people who don't even try to understand science. I get it, it's a marketing ploy. I know you'd  claim the food was blessed by wood nymphs if you thought it would sell better.
124149619252_10151486609219253:Don't CARE that the guac is extra...gotta have some of that with my chicken, corn salsa and pico, cheese, lettuce, black beans, white rice, and sour cream....YUM! I have a card for buy one get one on my desk....at WORK....
124149619252_10152429436247741:Thank you thank you thank you for the pronunciation guide! :) People really struggle with "chipotle" for some reason.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito Bol...rice, carnitas, pinto beans, green tomatillo salsa, cheese, sour cream and guaq.  Of course, with a side of chips!
124149619252_10152990683604253:Any way to stop using rice bran and other Whole 30 non compliant oils? Myself and many others on this lifestyle are extremely limited at your restaurant because of this.  If chicken, steak, onions/peppers could be cooked in a compliant oil, myself, hundreds and thousands of friends on Whole30 forums, and many more in the US would be thrilled!
124149619252_10153170449024253:Matthew Gonsalves you know Chipotle is ruined if one of the authors of your APEng readings is there ???????? jkjk
124149619252_10151611917404253:Come to Duluth, MN!! We have forced ourselves to survive long enough without a chipotle but I don't know how much longer we will last.
124149619252_10152453918534253:Hot heads burritos much better better variety,especially for those with texture problems and cant have veggies or chunks at all. Also a ton of sauces to choose from and many other menu options more than chipolte.
124149619252_10151149854849253:I sent my request to the chipotle website that I wanted a chipotle in Fort Wayne, Indiana and we had them a year later!!!!
124149619252_10153440997234253:illuminati is from the devil get rid of it he speaks right to you frim this talking bout hiding in stuff i revuke this page in the name of jesus
124149619252_10153163816204253:Chipotle you know darn well you love putting the scared young new hires on the line to give us our teaspoon of rice and 4 cubes of chicken in our burrito.
124149619252_10152250518069253:This is really widespread. I think you're going to have to ready your employees and make a WAY bigger statement then the one above which is also filled with contempt and sarcasm. I knew it wasn't real because most of the free offers are young people trying to get followers. However, you're going to have a lot of disappointed people who don't actually follow your statements
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl with brown rice, half black beans & half pinto beans, half portion of chicken, lettuce, pico de gallo, medium salsa, a little bit of cheese, and guacamole! Oh yeah, & lately I put a splash of the salad dressing on my creation! SOOOOoooo tasty...I just might have to go tomorrow to get it!
124149619252_10152560126959253:Extra Barbacoa Burrito (Inside the Bowl) White Rice, Black & Pinto Beans, Grilled Onions (No Peppers), Lettuce, Tomatoes, Corn, Hot Salsa, Mild Salsa, Sourcream, Extra Cheese & Of Course Some GUACAMOLE <3 #ChipotleLover
124149619252_10151149863494253:Ok . . . i like the food here BUT . .. WHATEVER IS IN THAT PAN - - YUK! Maybe you need to get a new photographer :)
124149619252_100913656591677:I love Chipotle!  They started right here in Denver.  When they had the one store and the line went around the block I remember thinking if only they would open another one.  They are a great success story!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Yo Chipotle. Sup with you guys running out of sofritas at lunch today? I waited a half hour only to be disappointed by not getting to try sofritas.
124149619252_10153262094399253:The thing is: you will lose a percentage of customers using GMO products. You will gain everyone when you take them off the list. Thank you Chipotle. Please come to Alberta!
124149619252_10151587164929253:I'm so happy you guys decided to label GMO!!! It's a big step and will lead other restaurants to do the same! You have my respect! 
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thank you chipotle! I truly respect you as a company! Love that you added Sofritas to the menu for us vegans :)
124149619252_213189592025031:Nothing like "Eating Out" I always say. Oh and Chipotle will get my money earth day or not. I'd rather eat there than any other fast food restaurant. CHIPOTLE RULES!!!
124149619252_10152586158139253:Still no Chipotle Mexican Grill in the west part of Germany, just in the middle 2 hours by car far away ????
124149619252_10151024826814253:i get a bowl and ask for a side of that vinegarette dressing and get some smoked tobasco and mix that in
124149619252_10151089035244253:Old Towne Alexandria! Though it's smaller than your other locations, King Street makes up for it. It's so beautiful and photograph-able.

124149619252_10153150981964253:Aniek van Kersen why have I liked this page on Facebook? It makes me depressed just to look at it because I can't eat it.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa Salad.  Barbacoa, fajita vegetables, hot sauce, and cheese.  Tastes incredible and makes me skinny.
124149619252_10153071160084253:I love chipotle  Cause it started in Colorado I'll continue to eat your burritos like there's no tomorrow
124149619252_10151878418689253:You bet you will. It's been a long time coming. I can hardly wait.  Thanks for such a quick response. Have I ever told you how much I love Chipotle ?????  I do, I do I do.
124149619252_10151961054499253:skillfully made? Chipotle...the restaurant in Highland Square neighborhood of Akron, Ohio must be the worst Chipotle ever! Today, my friend and I each "ordered" double meat on our bowl. One of us did not get double meat. I could tell the burrito maker was trying to stretch the ingredients out to accommodate more guests.  This location also does not LISTEN they are too worried about getting people thru the line. A bit of advice.....slow down!  I am sick of incontinent serving sizes, different scoopers = different proportions.  If there were FREEBIRDS in Ohio, they would close down every Chipotle.
124149619252_10152323527922741:I watched the inside chipotle special and the analyst that kept saying "chipolte"would fail was driving me bonkers. I couldn't take him seriously because the chipotle employee in me was screaming "it's chipoTLe!" Haha.
124149619252_10151089035244253:i'll tell you about the one i HATE the most.. in Cerritos, CA.. they are very stingy with their food... it is the worst Chipotle in the State of California
124149619252_135356053201187:@Whitney Hawkins, I beg to differ. They don't just hire hispanics. My location I work at is very diversed. I'm not hispanics, does that prove it to you that Chipotle isn't racist? Maybe it's you they don't want to hire, especially with that attitude of yours. They hire positive people who are hard workers, not because they/we are hispanics.
124149619252_140229971715:FYI, this is ONLY for Arizona. Most markets don't even have the Kid's Meal yet, so no bother calling your local Chipotle. We are doing this step by step. Hang tight! - Colin
124149619252_10152927494854253:Blue lives matter! Screw your company! Will never eat at any of your restaurants in my city or in any city I go to!
124149619252_10153246130479253:You guys are awesome!!! Bought our lunch AND dinner from you guys today in support of your progressive and responsible decision to eliminate GMOs from your menu - THANK YOU!!! ????????
124149619252_10151089035244253:Chipotle on Las Vegas Blvd, in Vegas. It's in the middle of all the fancy eat out place and what ever said and done Chipotle is a life saver when it comes to eating out in Vegas. I love to pay 6 dollars for a meal when my previous meal that I ate was 25 dollars in a fancy restaurant :))
124149619252_10150672519564253:Also the one in Dewitt NY is a tough layout to park. Not to mention the other parking lot exit you can only turn right...away from the main road. Great store tough parking.
124149619252_100780796665922:I've never tried Qdoba and never will - if it aint broke don't fix it. I figured they weren't the same and this just confirms my assumption. Thanks for sharing!
124149619252_10152323527922741:Also, Kacie Priebe, the problem with the antibiotic usage in livestock is that it isn't saved for when they're sick--the animals are given antibiotics to fatten up, so you get more meat out of one animal. It's seriously unhealthy and abusive toward the animals but it's also unhealthy for anyone to consume antibiotics unnecessarily. Ever notice that your dr. wants tests done before you get an antibiotic Rx? Overconsumption causes resistance in the bacteria, creating superbugs that then cannot be fixed with antibiotics.  PS. In the description it clearly states this is a comedy series (although some might argue it's horror) NOT A DOCUMENTARY.
124149619252_10153066985824253:I will drive from Winnipeg to go to there.  But you should maybe open one in Winnipeg too just in case I really like it.
124149619252_10153830182809253:I just had a burrito few minutes ago in Chipotle,London Charing Cross and very happy!!!!The best burritos ever!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak fajita burrito, white rice, black beans, sour cream, cheese, corn, tomatoes, medium sauce,  lettuce, and guacamole on the side! (: now I want one. 
124149619252_266206333465511:I've checked in like 5 times via foursquare in the last week and haven't received my groupie badge :(
124149619252_267832333301923:Even if the entire price of a bag is a donation, what happens to the ridiculous amount in shipping? It just doesn't make sense. There are so many better ways to support the same cause, with more of the money being put to good use.
124149619252_109031815838831:"My" Chipotle has gone through so many managment and personnel changes. I miss the old management and personnel. We've been going there for years but no one knows us anymore. Change is sad.
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito bowl, white rice, black beans, chicken, corn salsa (favorite!!), sour cream, cheese, lettuce...    with a tortilla on the side....and a lid, because I can never eat the whole thing in one sitting :)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Vegetarian (actually vegan)  salad-brown rice, black beans, a ton of fajitas, mild and corn salsa...if I wanna mix it up, I have the lime cilantro rice instead of the brown!
124149619252_10151961054499253:I've had rude service at the chipotle in Denver.  The food was cold.  I did not go back.  Must beer the air.  I've had good service and patient servers in Florida but not in palm bay because palm bay likes chipotle but chipotle doesn't like palm bay
124149619252_100780796665922:qdoba has consistently messed up my burrito (i wanted to say the f word, but this is a family forum, i suppose.) and i will never go back. chipotle4life. keep on keeping on, soldiers!
124149619252_10153423452749253:Chipotle Mexican Grill: I'm still kinda salty over Teacher Appreciation Week-this was the first year you didn't do anything & my husband & I drove to Chipotle for a nice BOGO burrito, only to be told "We don't do that anymore". Not ????
124149619252_365284166822162:As to the answer who would bring chipotle to a super bowl party. I would and I guarantee it will be first thing gone
124149619252_10151839071994253:Who care! When you've been without it for almost 2.  Years! Everything in Germany is freaking expensive!
124149619252_205455487672:Holy fucking shit.  I miss Chipotle so much.  I use to live in Colorado and ate at the orginal resturant.  Now I live in Italy and I miss it so much.  Open Chipotle in Rome!!!
124149619252_10151251776579253:Know what I love about Chipotle?? The FANS!!!  I work for a Chipotle, and man we have some real die-hard, eat there every day kinda fans!!
124149619252_100913656591677:Sounds like a date with Chipotle's is in order for the weekend...for now, got my fav spot Hops on the brain!
124149619252_100721619944214:Mmmm! I absolutely love Chipotle. Vegetarian tacos!!! Extra guac, please! Too bad the nearest one is 4 hours away! :(
124149619252_213264065363407:Chipoltle...goreat new place to eat...but not great for donations...Spring Township Pig Roast, looking for donations...Chipotle...NADA!!!!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Someone must really like chipotle... lol i mean i was tooo ready to go get my free burrito!! But... at least who ever started the hoax was generous enough to make all us dumba**es come like ur page!! Lol
124149619252_10152406485254253:Why don't you just put a target on your forehead? You might have well said...."Come on in and rob us. We have no protection." Just plain ignorant.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Let's ban bananas and seedless watermelon next! FACT: Everyone who has ever ate a Banana has died or will die in about the next 100 years??
124149619252_10152308701909253:Well you keep making more and more changes that people don't like, we will see how sustainable you are.....
124149619252_10152250518069253:I saw this post, and having a brain, like I have and use, I checked it out on a legitimate page...their own page!  But I am amazed how so many people now think they deserve a burrito because some loser posted it and they believed it.  What is wrong with people today?  Let me post a FREE car advertisement and see who thinks they should get a free car just because...and "there's no such thing as a free lunch" is a saying...get with it...PEOPLE ARE SOOOOOO STUPID!
124149619252_267832333301923:Desde que empezaron a sacar los mexicano a hora todo.  Chipotle ya no lo mantienen limpio  que gacho a mi me gusta comer chipote  
124149619252_267832333301923:For $26, you can DIRECTLY support a local farmer by shopping their farmer's market, instead of letting Chipotle donate a small percentage of it.
124149619252_10151024826814253:I like the order where I get a over a pound of food for $6. You know, the one that you guys don't sell anymore? I really wish you guys would stop cutting down the portions AND raising the prices -_-
124149619252_156053474470:Please come to Cleveland Ohio more specifically middleburg hts and strongsville, I know so many ppl tht would die for this and eat chipotle everyday
124149619252_10152250518069253:Yes this posting is not OUR fault. You don't have to be so rude about it. Chick-Fil-A sounds better for lunch...
124149619252_10151486609219253:steak burrito bowl - brown rice, black beans, corn salsa,sour cream, cheese and lettuce.....YUMMMM!  Had one yesterday :  )
124149619252_10153132892604253:unfortunately it has celentro in it and I can't stand it.  I love quac but they don't serve it without the celentro
124149619252_10153806089609253:I'm tired of hearing about Monsanto trying to take them down so I made a petition. Please sign it if you want to keep Chipotle around or don't if you want Monsanto to win.https://www.change.org/p/everyone-stop-monsanto-and-other-big-corporations-in-taking-down-chipotle
124149619252_10153009001449253:I was very much looking forward to doing this, but alas, like many others I'm stuck at home now due to Juno.  I hope there are plans to extend this somehow!  Thanks for doing this!
124149619252_10152569192869253:I love Chipotle. I've spent close to 40 dollars a week there for close to a year but your recent price hike are making it difficult for me to go there as much as I used to. I understand its a business and the droughts have made your ingredients more expensive but as a company valuated at over $600 a share I was hoping you would hold off longer on raising prices. Now I find myself skipping the guac (which is also higher) or just not going at all and eating someplace with less quality and cheaper price. Just wanted to vent 
124149619252_10152054390879253:Thanks, I asked a yr ago & can't  wait to see this sign cumin soon to Snellville, GA...just saw city  council confirmation in local patch
124149619252_10152250518069253:Hey oscar no one cares that you don't enjoy chipotle. Go eat at qdoba with the rest of the chumps who don't know better.
124149619252_10151089035244253:College park Maryland is by far the best chipotle I've been to and I've been to an abundance of chipotle. Their providing a great service to those students they really hook it up and I don't even go to school their I go to udel in Newark and the chipotle their is far below par then what I expect from chipotle 
124149619252_10153009001449253:hoping that this promotion is rescheduled for the Northeast! all Chipotles in the NYC area were closed today due to the blizzard tonight :'(
124149619252_199537401806:Huntsville! PLEASE OPEN IN HUNTSVILLE! AlaBAMA. Many hungry engineers. (Yes, I'm the crazy chick that keeps asking you...)

124149619252_10152406485254253:Gosh, Chipotle must either hate freedom, or money. Their discrimination will lose them a lot of money. With 110,000,000 freedom loving American, publicly discriminating even a fraction of us will prove to be a costly mistake.
124149619252_10151089035244253:Duluth, GA (Pleasant Hill Rd.)...it's like Cheers..."sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name"...and that they do....I go so much I need a punch card...
124149619252_454413931302356:And to all those people that did the Chick Fil A kiss in boycott, how did that go for ya?  Not well, but remember all those that supported Chick Fil A, on that great day, the lines wrapped around the side of the buildings but the love in by the g & l was not even new worthy.  Remember that Chipotle?
124149619252_10153543212484253:Honestly this festival was a fail. Don't plan on going back again. You had to get four stamps, one from each exhibit that easily had a 40 minute line, so a total of 2 hours and 40 minutes just to get a free burrito? I'd rather just buy it. Ran out of Surly Furious which was slightly disappointing, ran out of North Face water bottles, and at that point we just left. At least the event was free though!
124149619252_10151024826814253:WE cAN'T EAT THERE ANYMORE!  We could eat bowls..gluten-free...but now you cook with soy, another VERY common allergen!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak fajita bowl,rice, mild salsa, corn salsa two scoops, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, and 3 small tortillas.
124149619252_10152990683604253:I was very disappointed with my last visit. I ordered 3 bowls and two sides and the bowls were only half full when everything was put in. I have never ordered a bowl and had it SO skimpy. I even said something about it and all they did was add half a spoon of rice. :-(
124149619252_199537401806:PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let it be West Virginia... Somewhere near the Parkersburg area! I miss my Chipotle and I've got my husband addicted.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Kimberly Raymond they treat their customers well enough with their quality food and customer service. What other company comes close for the price?
124149619252_10151024826814253:Black beans, brown rice, fajitas, medium salsa, corn salsa, guacamole, lettuce. Keepin' it meat and dairy free.
124149619252_10151961054499253:To anyone complaining about portions, not that it's endorsed or appreciated by the company, but when my store started dishing out less portions (or just specific people) I would sit there and tell them to add more until it was a reasonable portion. Arguing is losing a customer, and the customer is more valuable than a tiny bit more product to them.
124149619252_10152996855759253:Just wanted to say thanks to the chipotle family for continuing. To set the bar for quality organic ingredients.
124149619252_10153706556384253:You guys definetly need some sort of reward system! Especially for those of us who go there every other day! ????????
124149619252_10152323527922741:It is sad to see you are using such a sick advertising campaign to promote your business, I was looking forward to going to your new restaurant in Fargo ND, but not anymore and I hope my friends will do the same. As a farmer I have great respect for your business model and your choice of products as I know it is not easy to source such a large amount of organic commodity's. unfortunately this sad  and sick ad campaign has changed my mind.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I ventured out just to go get a sofrita, and they were out. I'M PISSED! How could they promote the hell out of this and not prepare??? South Tampa, Fl
124149619252_10152406485254253:Chipotle for the win I'm glad you respect constitutional rights and state laws open carrys is legal..all these people talking about gun free zones yea way to make yourself the victim don't like guns don't buy one don't call the cops cause they have guns too chipotle for the win!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Store is out of stock and no indications of that until you get to the counter after standing in a long line. Seems like a neat but cheap trick to get a sales boost. How else can you explain that, did you really not see this coming.
124149619252_454413931302356:hey chipotle screw you!! and your sponsorship, i think the boyscouts can live without you. im sure once this gets out churches will not eat there! i think there are more people against homos than are for it. i know you can turn your restaurant into a sandusky fan club. jerks
124149619252_10153302438484253:Leeann Alberttar Loux Michelle Nani I love hearing stories of young people with vision and living out their purpose. I want to encourage my favorite sister tag team, you work for the King; Chipotle just provides the means. #GenerationOfImpact #CallingAllLeaders #RiseDaily #VisionInTheMarketplace
124149619252_10152120952294253:I heard on the news you guys were planning on using non-gmo ingredients soon. Way to go chipotle! Now you'll be even more irresistible.
124149619252_10152707070879253:Colin Burns - I've already looked into it. It's near my office..and I TOTALLY want to go, but I will be in LBK that wknd watching the Red Raiders plan!

124149619252_10153736393409253:i knew people would get sick at this restaurant because i go to the one in coral spring and the same gloves they use to handle the food they used to hold papers,draws,counter and other stuff dont get me wrong its the best and very healthy but the workers needs to be more careful with what they hold with the glove then use it on the food
124149619252_10152883478794253:Eeewwwww, you guys may want to address this or you may have kyle and the 2 others posting Likes as your only loyal customers. Sadly, those in the chain in other states will suffer for your actions and subsequent lack thereof.
124149619252_10150942028479253:I'm sitting in  Chipotle right now.  Chicken burrito, white rice, fajitas, mild, sour cream, cheese, and a Negra Modelo to wash it all down...   It was perfect...
124149619252_10152560126959253:Steak bowl, brown rice, black beans, medium salsa, corn salsa, extra sour cream, extra cheese, and guac.
124149619252_10151826977069253:please open a chipotle in South Korea, I'll be here for a year and there are no mexican restaurants or burrito shops anywhere... i'm dying without chipotle

124149619252_212886842115332:That was stupid i went in dressed like a burrito after school and then they told me it was only after 6 o clock
124149619252_192398874125268:My husband & I love Chipotle, my kids... not so much, only because they're kids and like pb&j and grilled cheese...now thats a resturant idea right there!  One who's main focus is children... with some treats on the menu for adults.  It's a struggle finding food that's fast and healthy for children and adults.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie Bowl with rice, veggies, extra of that yummy guac, cheese, spicy red salsa, and corn! I love you Chipotle.
124149619252_10151486609219253:Not enough food! We have been going to chipotle ever since they opened up in central ohio. Please answer me why our burritos are 20-30 % smaller...
124149619252_10151961054499253:Thanks for the heads up Michelle Gwinn, and we're sorry! We'll certainly address and fix your concerns with our Highland Square restaurant, as we always endeavor to listen and give consistent portions to our customers. - Joe
124149619252_10153088156639253:Will there be free food from Chipotle? I don't care about the ideas musicians just bring the chefs and the chipotle burritos and chips and guacamole
124149619252_205082546217004:Great victory for the marketing and PR department.....but perceived and actual are two differnet statistics.
124149619252_10151024826814253:hahahajust finished a steak burrito with hot sauce, black beans, dirty rice and sour cream - gotta love it!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Crunchy tacos w/ steak, onion/peppers, sour cream, and cheese. Oh, don't for get the hot salsa and chips Mmmm
124149619252_10152250518069253:Esmeralda Preciado Torres I'll buy you Little Caesar's $5 pizza if you buy me a burrito from chipotle.
124149619252_10152825448969253:Anna, we've been doing #Boorito since the late 90s and we plan to keep up the tradition. We hope we'll see you next year. -Skyllo
124149619252_185864848093833:THE FDA IS RUN BY A BUNCH OF LIARS!!!! THEY ARE THE ONES THAT COULD CARE LESS IF THESE ANTIBIOTICS ARE GIVEN TO THESE ANIMALS AND NONE OF US KNOW ABOUT IT SO THEY TRY TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THEY ARE TAKING CARE OF SOMETHING THEY CAUSED!!!
124149619252_10151089035244253:lemmon ave in dallas, tx. great service. especially the girl with the short blonde cut, she's great!!!
124149619252_10151086390274253:@sean nichols-- I hear they're putting a chipotle in where the brewhouse was on mccarran and kietzke.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Hahaha people calling Chipotle greedy when they are crying bcs they don't get a 6 dollar burrito for free. Y'all is hypocriticizers.
124149619252_363324750372027:This would be difficult to achieve as in the closest Chipotle is about 3.5 hours away... BRING ONE TO PENSACOLA!!!
124149619252_267832333301923:Can we bring the bag for our burritos when we buy Chipotle instead of having them put in a paper bag?
124149619252_10151024826814253:Same thing every time BOWL= White rice(easy) ....hold the beans + steak + mild salsa + extra corn salsa + cheese + extra sour cream,,, side cup of guacamole & bag o' chips = YUMMINESS!!
124149619252_10153262094399253:I usually have Pico De Gallo in the fridge,I add that to my guacamole,with some lime, sour cream ????????

124149619252_10152343053104253:Found this out a couple years ago when I tried to go to one on Goucher Blvd. I went to Applebee's instead that day. But, I wouldn't mind a burrito for Easter. :)
124149619252_10153083685269253:Just curious, do you guys cater? Because it would be an awesome idea for a birthday or graduation party. I mean, who doesn't love chipotle?!
124149619252_10153267989814253:Hii Elba saw Frankie in concert thought about you,when  he sung Cant get over you.......stay healthy hope to see you soon.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Really?  Isn't BOGO getting a free burrito?  From your March 5th post, "Wear your official LA Galaxy apparel into any LA-area Chipotle on March 8th and score a BOGO. Locations: http://chip.tl/uVWK0X -Joe #ChipotleHomegrown"
124149619252_130482563683418:The line in Woodbridge, VA is ALWAYS crazy long and wraps all the way around the entire store so the wait is long. I think the spice on the chicken is what tips it over. Love that Qdoba has room for me and a loyalty program and Moe's Monday is a great deal!
124149619252_10151089035244253:The one in Louisville KY... Oh no wait there isn't one. Come on I promise it would do great. Please come here.
124149619252_10153112208029253:I was goin to like this page cuz I saw "mexican grill" but, its obvious, you dont know nothing about tacos.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl, brown rice, black beans, veggies, steak, mild salsa, lettuce, cheese, guacamole. Best. Lunch. Ever.
124149619252_244699472217532:Sarah, your organizations can always contact us at at: http://www.chipotle.com/en-US/company/philanthropy.aspx - Joe
124149619252_10153693560944253:Hey, I keep going to stores in Virginia and they run out of chips or tacos shells if I go in the evening. How early should I make it there to get taco shell tacos?
124149619252_10153602183249253:i saw this ad and thought it extremely low....yes like some on here i had to wonder whether this was fake or not but to just dismiss it like it wasnt is also not so smart ...i wonder if it was a place that abused animals or killed animals for gain if you would all feel the same or would you also be a little upset..its ok to be loyal to something you like that doesnt mean you have to dismiss everything else as garbage or trolling ...i agree more needs to be said from dhipotle because this can't be all it takes to convince some people smh on all accounts .......
124149619252_10152935096524253:Orland park, il .... Guess I have to change my plans... Dinner for 5 cancelled tonight! Goodbye my favorite CHIPOTLE UNTIL YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS! #ISUPPORTFIRSTRESPONDERS
124149619252_10153830182809253:I havent let this stop me from eating my chipotle. All it means for me is a shorter line and it is always clean when I go in. Which is like 3x's/week. I love Chipotle!
124149619252_454413931302356:So, withholding $4,200 in coupons is smart huh? I figure you only need about 50 people like me to never show up again in your chain, to say nothing about all of the BSA family's that are likely not to spend any of their money there to overcome that business decision. That's a really brilliant business decision...you should have considered the Starbucks decision on guns in their stores....first, they don't pick up these social fights and they follow the laws in whatever state they are in....what a bunch of dweebs!
124149619252_119322358240818:does this farm also keep it's dairy cows pregnant all the time like other farms to meet the demand of those larger farms? and what happens to the calves?
124149619252_193346814021706:Just to be clear, I enjoy Chipotle. I am willing to stand in rush hour lunch time lines to get my food. It's worth it. But, even the best things always have room for improvement.  I Just believe creating a standardized measurement for the meat is a great idea. That small thing could eliminate someone in the prep line from leaving a bad vibe on my burrito.
124149619252_130482563683418:Defininitely better than Salsarita's, Moe's & Qdoba. Just wish you would finally add queso to the menu. Ok, it's not healthy, but it's good. 
124149619252_10151086390274253:Gooooo USA! Too cool to have the two USA teams in the gold medal match!!!! I hope Misty gets another GOLD!
124149619252_185864848093833:The workers on farms thatgrow chicken for purdue are around so many antibiotics that they become allergic to antibiotics. And I just ate some purdue chicken...
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa burrito, extra rice, no beans, mild salsa, corn, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, and the spicy salad dressing. Amazing!!
124149619252_178542422170361:Congrats Chipotle! December has been a big, big month for expansion. Keep showing the others how it's done!
124149619252_10152082036279253:what ever do see in my future don't change what you have now don't take away my chipotle past!... I love it now- its taste like REAL FOOD.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Honoring that would have given people the will to do it again. Making fake advertisements; which chipotle doesn't do. There wants even a reason unlike boorito & the fundraisers they do. They care about there customers, but it seems people are starting to advantage of it. But I agree the post crushing everyone's day plan could have been a little sweeter.
124149619252_10152883474639253:Come to southeast texas. Beaumont, Orange, Lumberton, Nederland, Port Neches, or Port Arthur. We need  it here ;-)
124149619252_10153423452749253:HEY FAM @Liberty Yang@Asheema Yang@Pavy Yang@Isabelle Thao@Paj Lee@Nina Lee@Brianna Lee@Madeline Khang
124149619252_10153498699374253:The Dark Act is passing through the Senate. This will remove all ingredient lists from our food. DARK - Denying Americans the Right to Know. We must stop this! Call your Senators!!  GMO FREE USA
124149619252_10151486609219253:I always have the "San Fransisco" burrito: aka the steak fajita burrito. Steak, fajita, cheese, sour cream, and corn salsa. YUM!
124149619252_10153656854824253:Ok this just made me hungry at damn near 12 o'clock at night....point me in the direction of a 24 hrs chipotle ????????
124149619252_115365598544868:Cut the PC crap about Earth Day - you've got to use energy to provide that food! A refrigerator to keep it fresh, stoves to cook it, and electricty to light and temp control the restaurant.  I'm sick of all of this "green" propaganda!
124149619252_109031815838831:I had chipotle for lunch 2 days ago, its probably my favorite I just hate that there's not one in my town. I have to drive about 30 mins to go there.
124149619252_10153246130479253:I just love everything About Chipotle... Except that you don't deliver.... To istanbul ???? lol expat probs
124149619252_266206333465511:We do not have a chipotle down here. Despite the fact we had the largest employer in the state (27k people), we still don't have one. So the only way I can go to chipotle is if I drive an hour or so to Atlanta. Please bring a chipotle to Warner robins. 
124149619252_10153246130479253:I also don't believe Chipotle would make such a big move if the decision WASN'T backed up by science. Do your research people. Look at peer-reviewed articles not funded by agribusiness
124149619252_10153246130479253:So proud of Chipoltle ! They've been my go to decent fast food restaurant because they care about their ingredients!
124149619252_10152236327209253:Only after reading some of these comments do I remember how spoiled I am to have two Chipotles, both less than 15 minutes from my house. I'm going to go get Chipotle to celebrate
124149619252_10153246130479253:Chipotle is not doing this for any reason other than to profit off of the current GMO paranoia.   I will not eat here again.
124149619252_10153246130479253:great marketing plan play to the fears of the unscientific http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/25/opinion/sunday/how-i-got-converted-to-gmo-food.html?_r=1
124149619252_10152250518069253:Wow, the fact that someone made something up on the Internet that causes direct harm to a business, they come out to clarify it and a bunch of people vilify them for it?  That makes a lot of sense... ;)
124149619252_10151086390274253:Good luck! Wish I cld have some Chipotle but haven't been able to stomach it since I got pregnant. 3 more months and I am getting a big burrito! lol
124149619252_10152250518069253:I've heard of free lunches and burritos lots of times. You guys even gave them in the past with gift card offers.
124149619252_185864848093833:You guys are starting to get cheap on the meat. I have stopped eating there because only get a half scoop of meat.
124149619252_130482563683418:From what I remember Chipotle makes your burritos and tacos "your way" and as you watch. Why not just ask for less rice?
124149619252_10152822056649253:I've tasted this pizza and it is amazing!! There is nothing like it. You feel full but unlike other pizzas there is no greasy feeling... This pizza is super tasty!
124149619252_10153001213604253:Thank You for standing up to the horrible food producers that is Ruining and poisoning the food chain and our environment. . .  Don't ever give up on your standards. . .
124149619252_213189592025031:Nice idea! Found some picnics in Columbus, OH. BTW, don't feed the Troll. Some comments should be IGNORED.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Why are you tagging me this!!! You know I didn't get my daily chipotle yet ???????????????????? ????? ????????
124149619252_10153830182809253:Can you please open a Chipotle in Aberdeen MD one day? The closest one to me is like 45 minutes away and that's not even including driving back, and I love Chipotle. :(
124149619252_10152810389849253:Reading comments like these and knowing how happy we make people makes me proud to be part of the Chipotle crew!!!
124149619252_10153246130479253:So glad to see this! I hope that more companies will follow your leadership. We don't eat out much, but when we do, it is usually Chipotle because of their standards for ingredients. Way to go Chipotle! Thank  you!!! :)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie burrito with white rice, fajita veggies, sour cream, cheese, hot sauce, corn salsa, and of course black beans. I love the barbacoa too!
124149619252_10151486609219253:white rice, black beans, half chicken & half steak, medium salsa, corn and sometimes sour cream.....now i want chipotle
124149619252_10153656854824253:Has anyone ever witness them make guac at Chipotle? I get the feeling it comes out of a giant plastic package.
124149619252_196891642078:Hardly unknown in the turn of the millenium! ..Grew up in Denver right by DU, where the first Chipotle was started.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Burrito.  Brown rice, black beans, chicken, sour cream, hot salsa for the flavor, mild salsa for the texture, cheese, lettuce--sometimes guac.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Anyone who doesn't order a steak burrito with cheese and lettuce should probably figure out where their life went horribly wrong.
124149619252_10152949800154253:Christine, I'm sorry the steak was so disappointing. May I suggest speaking to the manager or writing us here: http://chip.tl/re0OLp so we have the chance to make amends? -Skyllo
124149619252_10152325977227741:Thank you Chipotle!! It means a lot to me as a consumer that you work hard to provide us a product that is healthy and GMO free. I love walking into your restaurant! Thank you, thank you!!
124149619252_10152250518069253:I figured it was a prank but as expensive as yall are can we get some coupons or something?  Sheesh!  Lol
124149619252_10153001213604253:Is throwing the farmers under the bus still going to be in the lineup?  That event seems quite popular at Chipotle.
124149619252_185864848093833:Exactly Katherine! They should only be used when needed, but unfortunately paying particular attention to each animal and when they need antibiotics would cost tons of money, increasing the price of meat even more :( 
124149619252_100780796665922:Today I went to chipotle for lunch and they were out of rice, so they gave everyone free drinks. By the time I was ready to order, they had more rice and stuffed my burrito with all the good stuff. Great service today, chipotle. Thanks!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Lets see...Bowl, brown rice, black beans, fajita stuff, chicken, pico, little bit of corn, sour cream, little bit of cheese, lettuce. Lime slices on the side.
124149619252_10152250518069253:I'm coming in to day to get my free Burrito .And it's free yummy,yes free, you heard me correct free and yummy to my free tummy 
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito bowl. White rice, hot salsa, corn salsa, cheese, sour cream. Chips on the side! Just wish y'all had queso dip.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa, brown rice, black beans, peppers and onions, cheese, lots of lettuce, a touch of sour cream, corn relish, medium salsa - and some chipotle Tabasco.  Repeat  ;-)
124149619252_10153521011509253:I HATE  taking Chipotle home. The food soaks through the cardboard bowl then through the bag...then splat all on the driveway !!!!!  Something needs to change with those bowls... THEN I WILL EAT AT CHIPOTLE AGAIN. #JS
124149619252_10151089035244253:i wanted to eat at your new concept in chicago this past weekend. could'nt find it and there wasnt a chipotle emloyee that new where it was.
124149619252_10150959152619253:Hubby just went to get take out from there I am too tired to go anywhere after my work out this eve 9 miles!
124149619252_134085872963:really bad video. it absolutely WAS gay and if you think saying that word makes you look like a homophobe then you need to go cry somewhere else like PC island or something. i say it and i'm not phobic at all. i have family that are homosexual. i will say this for these videos... these dudes that put the time into it HAVE to know how ridiculous and shitty these things were yet still had the balls to put it on the netz and they now have more free money than i do so props for making an ass out of yourself on here. now in order to free myself of this ridiculousness i'm deleting myself from the chipotle page.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl with chicken, peppers & onions, black beans, rice, pico de gallo, corn salsa, mild salsa, hot salsa (on the side), extra cheese, sour cream (on the side - tastes horrible when you reheat it), a smidge bit of lettuce, guac and 2 salad dressings..the salad dressing sets it OFF! =)
124149619252_10153302438484253:We marched past your Ann Arbor state Street location during #MarchAgainstMonsanto and your employees cheered us! We responded with sending over 200 activists to that location for after March dinner. Thank you Chipotle for taking a stand against GMOs!
124149619252_10152489832309253:DID YOU THROW THIS FOOD AWAY AND CLEAN AND STERIZE THE GLASS AFTER THIS?????  https://www.facebook.com/DailyCaller/photos/a.193790486769.136864.182919686769/10152108867301770/?type=1&relevant_count=1
124149619252_175763983493:I want to open one in my city.....we need one here desperately but I dont know where t start with that...
124149619252_10151486609219253:White rice. Extra rice. No beans. 1/2 steak, 1/2 barbacoa. Hot salsa. Extra hot salsa. Sour cream. Cheese. Guacamole. Sprinkle some lettuce for a good measure.
124149619252_10152534981604253:I was there last week and got this cup.  I can honestly say I have never felt so inspired as when I read this during my salad.  Enough so I took a picture and loaded to to my page. Thanks Chipotle!!
124149619252_10152883478794253:Erin Montrie Theresa Franzinger Schwartz  Eva Compisi Stephanie Gioia Stewart Shauna Burens Alison Radelet Zlatic Is Castle-licious a name?
124149619252_10152805746454253:If I had one, it would be brown rice, barbacoa, fajita veggies, hot & corn salsa, and cheese. Alas, I has no boorito, and I is sad.
124149619252_100780796665922:I am Team Chipotle everyday, all day.  I'm sad to be moving back to Huntsville, AL in a few months bc there is no Chipotle there. I ate at Qdoba years ago, before I was introduced to Chipotle.  It is no wonder that I married the man that brought Chipotle into my life.  That all being said, I think my head would explode if Chiptole introduced a queso option.
124149619252_10153656854824253:My inner Type A loves the one-man assembly line process! (& Chipotle...& guac...& yes, I know it's extra)

124149619252_10152250518069253:FYI ... To those who don't agree with my comment.. I happen to have worked for this company and they are a great company, but as I said it is a part of customer service!!!!!!!
124149619252_10153200118729253:I always wonder if I would , ok then lol , I'm going to own 1 won day , lol but they should be more of those in the lower income spots all over the world , #chipotlefever
124149619252_10151486609219253:Burrito bowl tortilla on the side, white rice, pinto beans, carnitas + Chicken, corn and mild salsa, sour cream lettuce...
124149619252_10151024826814253:steak salad:  lettuce,  rice, half and half for beans, fajita veggies, steak (if not too pink), corn salsa, pico de gallo, and a light sprinkling of cheese, lots of honey chipotle dressing!
124149619252_10151316869709253:Glad to see you giving your employees the day off.  The good thing about Chipolte, it warms up well so you can still get your Chipolte the day before.  Just do the lettuce and sour cream on the side!  :)
124149619252_10153246130479253:Great....so bye to GMO which will drive up costs even more. $15 for a burrito?  SURE!!!!!    #SARCASM
124149619252_10152250518069253:I don't get why people think Chipotle should apologize here. Someone else put out the scam, they had nothing to do with it.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Salad with chicken, onions & peppers, green salsa, guacamole (pronounced "whakamoleh") and LOVE that dressing with a kick!
124149619252_10152805746454253:Awaiting the opening of Chipotle's in Augusta, Maine.  When are you opening?  Loved ya when our family "found" you in Austin, Texas years ago!  Yum.
124149619252_10151089035244253:I'd love to but there aren't any in RockSprings Wyoming.  Or Wyoming at all!!  Miss me some burritos!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Just another reason the majority of the population will not return to chipotle. Might as well have a free day and make more fans with the price raise.
124149619252_322643590240:Brandon -- because parents like me have been begging for a decent kids menu for years now! People of ALL ages like Chipotle...yes even us old farts in our 30's with young kids.  But...without a decent kids meal, we are left to order cheese quesadillas and then pack foods from home for them. Lame. Hopefully the kids meals will spread throughout all Chipotles, and fast!
124149619252_109031815838831:I'm just happen when i get to the front of the line and they say hi welcome to Chipotle what can i get for you.. that just makes everything better
124149619252_10151089035244253:Man where are ones that look like that? The two I go to out here look exactly the same. Costa Mesa and Irvine CA
124149619252_10153281032634253:Let's open Chipotle in the Conyers, Covington,Decatur, Lithonia, Stone Mountain area. That's Georgia baby.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Is it the bt in the gmo corn that is bad??? Organic farmers drench their crops in bt to control lepidoptrian insects.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito! Brown or White rice, steak, mild salsa, cheese and sour cream! Brings it all together with a Minute Maid Lemonade. :)
124149619252_100780796665922:My wife and I used to live in a small college town in NC and would drive 2 1/2 hours to pick up Chipotle, 6 burritos at a time! There is no other, we call it "the burrito place."
124149619252_10151316869709253:working at a Chipolte i have to say thank you first job i've ever had that's been closed for their employees to see their family i love working here they treat us with respect and the hours are  always more or less fair  we are people to how would  some  office workers didn't get xmas off or new years they would riot and protest  chipolte is not like working at a fast food place  it harder than when  i was a waiter at 4 star restraunt  and im a cashier not even the back of house so thanks for making all of us at the kings mills ohio chipolte happy
124149619252_10152250518069253:There is a such thing as free lunch. IHOP gave free pancakes yesterday ALL DAY. breakfast, lunch and dinner. I still <3 Chipolte
124149619252_10151089035244253:scottsdale az, bell road. the staff there is amazing!! and soon it will be Vestal, NY as soon as it opens!!!(!which is super soon i hope)
124149619252_10152881169974253:This is OK, but we did a 100 person order and there weren't enough vegetables and way too much beans and rice.....it would have been better if there was more meat...
124149619252_156053474470:okay i live like literally a minute down the street from chipotle BUT STILL. DO THIS IN CALIFORNIA. DO IT!
124149619252_140837186009517:willie and chipotle!!.....r those angels in the backround im hearing!! i met willie once i wish it had been in a chipotle!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Just waited in line for a good half an hour only to find out at the actual counter (thanks to a very small sign) that sofritas were out. I love the campaign and love that you pushed people to want to try the vegan option, but the fact that our and it seems many other locations ran out in an hour and then the replacement was substitute it with any meat just basically made it so that more animals were consumed than usual. Somewhat ironic. Hoping for better planning next time.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I went and waited for 45 minutes in an insanely long line. Out of sofritas. Why didn't you plan for this, Chipotle?
124149619252_10153530958859253:Please come to Sioux Falls SD. I know the place you could go into because a small business just closed.  You would be next to Jimmy John's.

124149619252_10151486609219253:Brown rice, blk beans, chicken, extra steak, extra barbacoa, pico, corn, cheese, sour cream....perfection in a tortilla.
124149619252_10152407734029253:The one thing I truly love about this country is people, and buisnesses both can spout out opinions and sides freely. If a company wants to be dumb enough to not stay neutral on subjects that will alienate costumers let them.  Gives more buisness to those who know costumer service and satisfaction comes above personal opions and beliefs.
124149619252_10152453918534253:I tried to get something off the secret menu about a week ago and the employees looked at me like it was the end of the world.. Great customer service...Why even advertise a "secret" menu
124149619252_10152262999499253:I can't yet commit to Meatless Mondays, but with this, I'm pretty sure I can do a Meatless Meal once a week!!
124149619252_10153246130479253:We're are you going to get your ingredients? That's a hit on the small farmer who is trying to cut back on nasty insecticides.
124149619252_346503142066549:So happy you're FINALLY coming to the Pentagon City Mall!  Going to Crystal City isn't far, but there's NO parking, so now I can just walk :)
124149619252_156053474470:I work at a business relatively close to the Chiptole in Rockford, IL.  Every time I want to order food for my break, I call Chipotle and ask if they deliver.  They don't and I usually end up getting "Jiffy Joes" next door.  Let's hope Chipotle Delivery spreads to Rockford!
124149619252_10152406485254253:This was a bad decision on Chipotle's part.  You will lose customers left and right (including this one).
124149619252_10151258924194253:Good! I am sick of seeing places open on Thanksgiving to feed the consumer greed. Because of this, we are having Chipotle for our PreThanksgiving dinner tonight! <3
124149619252_10153389325099253:Everywhere but close to home....need one in like Towanda, Mansfield(college town) maybe even Williamsport(home of The Little League World Series) all in Pennsylvania
124149619252_10153009001449253:Annabelle Wagner even though you prob already saw this since you followed chipotle way before me.....
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa Bol: 1 scoop rice, little bit black bean, extra mild, medium & corn salsa, sour cream, and cheese please! ("please" makes it even better! <3)
124149619252_134085872963:Okay this is the GAYEST, that's right Kimberly, GAYEST shit I've ever seen. 1st place was a million times better.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Lisa Culver I don't think you understand what gmo even is, DNA wasn't even discovered till 1935, the first gmo was created in the 80's. Selective breading and gmo are not the same thing.
124149619252_10152262999499253:I was totally bummed last week when I went to my local Chipotle (8th st. near NYU) around 1:30 in the afternoon only to learn that they were out of Sofritas and to come back tomorrow!  How hard is it to keep some tofu in stock?!  I have a feeling that it would've been a much bigger deal to the restaurant had Barbacoa or Carnitas been out of stock.  If you're going to go to such great lengths to give compassionate consumers a choice, then the least you can do is keep it in stock!
124149619252_199537401806:I stress...SUMTER, SC.  Originally from Toledo, OH...Can't take not having a Chipotle within 3 hours of me!!!!!!!!!!!

124149619252_10152809793874253:We're prepped and ready at the Mall Blvd. Chipotle! Come on in and show off your costumes and get a $3 Boorito!!!
124149619252_10153310575624253:Let's open Chipotle n the Conyers, Covington, Decatur, Lithonia, Stone Mountain, area. That's Georgia baby.
124149619252_10152883478794253:food was decent at best but service was TERRIBLE AND RUDE. the employee was nasty and rude... and we will never go back. a friend and i went the other day to try them out and she asked for a meat quesadilla and the woman kept asking "cheese?" "no meat" "chease?" "NO meat" "yes but do you want cheese?" <<--- figure at this point she was asking if we wanted cheese AND meat.... "sure put cheese on it" get to the registar "so this is a chesse quesadilla?" "no it should be meat" girl who made it comes over and says "i asked you many times if you wanted meat" "ummm no you asked if she wanted cheese.... over and over again" keep in mind that a line of people have formed behind us and now there are courious people looking that were seated. nice job... never will go back again. i open the foil to my tacos and guess what...surprise she drained nothing and they leaked liquid and were soggy. but yeah... that was a fantastic experience. i will tell all my friends to go to this location if they want to deal with rude, nasty customer service and soggy tacos. where do you get these great employees... you just opened and have people who are that nasty already?! got to love augusta maine... congrats on your lovely new store. i hope you get the customers you deserve based on the employees you hired
124149619252_10150602702709253:I wish more people would have voted and made it an actual haiku contest, not a popularity contest. :( I thought mine were pretty funny. 
124149619252_10150719072154253:I say thanks for being closed too!  Lets your employees celebrate a special day with family and friends.  Hope they make it to church too!!!  Thanks again for honoring this most important holiday celebrating the resurrection of Jesus.
124149619252_156053474470:Heck yeah...I have been freaking on bedrest for two weeks and gonna be for the next 3-4.  Ya'll need to test this out in Denton, Texas too!!!!!!!!!  I'll support it!
124149619252_10153569576059253:okay i love this whole campaign.. process not processed... we have a lot of great processes in house we could feature! Jessica Rosser Erick Diaz Michael Georgopoulos
124149619252_10152599784994253:Love the local grown!! As for andrea carter snow, sorry that your experience at that ONE Achipotle was horrible but that shouldn't stop you from trying others since Chipotle really is a great company with great food
124149619252_10152406485254253:He didn't say commandment, That's a profile clearly operated by someone on the left with lots of free time.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl with white rice, pinto beans, chicken, cheese, sour cream, guac, every salsa except corn, and lettuce on top.  With the green tabasco and salt.
124149619252_10152805746454253:Chicken, white rice, cheese and sour cream!  Hmmm...thinking I might have to get that for lunch tomorrow !
124149619252_10151089035244253:"about your favorite location"  Well, it is located right on the main drag just off of the Indiana University Campus and it has lots of nice outside seating!
124149619252_156053474470:how lazy can people get that they cant even go to chipotle to get their burrito. PATHETIC. this is why america is the fattest nation in the world. anything with effort is shunned
124149619252_10152453918534253:Yea man..... This specific chipotle blows. They skimp on everything .... Even beans. Food is cold and employees are often rude
124149619252_10153806089609253:Love Chipotle!  Have eaten there many times over the past few months and am doing just fine.  Not worried and will be back again!  Thank you for your commitment to non-GMO!
124149619252_10152632602189253:Adrian  everytime I have chipotle I think of you lol btw that's totally your next bday cake! Haha and for your gift I'll get you the guacamole shirt! Lol jk love you miss you
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito: White Rice. 1/2 Steak, 1/2 Barbacoa. Black Beans. LOTS of red sauce. Cheese. Lettuce. Sour Cream. :D Perfection!
124149619252_10152407734029253:A Texas restaurant with Texas pride. Thank you for not cowering to Chicago/New York liberal thugs. We will stand with you and believe me, you have lost nothing with these not coming to your restaurant.  You have gained because now your place will stay respectable.  You are awesome! Thank you!
124149619252_10153009001449253:PLEASE Chipotle Mexican Grill... let us vegans replace the sour cream and cheese for guac at no extra charge!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl.....brown rice, black beans, steak (lately no meat), pico, guacomole, lettuce (extra lettuce)!!!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:You probably shouldn't be promoting something you are having a "nationwide shortage" of. Also, it would be helpful if they posted signs outside so that we didn't waste 40 minutes in line for something you don't even have!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Can you explain to us why this is somehow an improvement? Can you cite any sources that prove GE ingredients should be avoided and why?
124149619252_10153009001449253:Don't visit Chipotle on 1/26 because instead of the usual 40 minute wait time, it will probably be 2 hours and 40 minutes!!!!  Love Chipotle though!
124149619252_10152927494854253:Wow. There must be a whole 20 revenue generators here saying they won't eat at Chipotle again. How will they ever survive?
124149619252_175763983493:I don't take much stock in the whole Global Warming theory, but for a couple months of Chipotle Burritos, I'll do a $10K budget production greener than Kermit's rear end!
124149619252_381121631938623:So.. epic thought here... You can get a free burrito by buying a gift card for a 'grad.' But REALLY, you can just keep the gift card AND get a free burrito :)  I'm doing that! ;)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa burrito bowl with brown rice, black beans, cheese, lettuce and sour cream and a side of chips... Now I'm hungry!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie bowl, lots of lettuce, brown rice, black beans, peppers&onions,corn&tomato salsa, guacamole and ummm...more lettuce=yummy;)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito. Chicken. Lots and lots and lots of black beans. Corn. White rice. Medium salsa. Sour cream. Guac. Yumm!! 
124149619252_131676086962937:mmmmmm chipotle a~os atras eras super rico pero ya no pero de igul manera me gusta ya no tiene el mismo sabor
124149619252_244699472217532:Great idea! I wrote to Chipotle asking if they'll ever provide brown rice, and they are testing it already and are  strongly considering it.  Good folks!
124149619252_10153736393409253:2nd time I've gotten sick at the chipotle in Norman Oklahoma. Yeah you're not getting my business again. Under cooked rice and stale chips? Really?
124149619252_10152881174584253:Awesome value. The chafing dishes and all included. Just had a staff meeting and it worked out perfect. They include everything. Very easy.
124149619252_10153656854824253:What I would do for that guac! ????????????????????Katrina Austria Marrero Christopher PerezSofia Ortega Crystal Castaneda PS They should have an avocado Emoji!!
124149619252_10151556916969253:I love you...You know that...BUT Allison Finkelstein Gorelick can't have the OPTIMAL Chipotle experience?  You're all natural and organic and yet no grilled veggies or roasted options???  What's up with that???
124149619252_10153246130479253:You can't blame Chipotle. They are doing what any smart business does:  catering to the preferences of their market, which consists of Americans with a stunning lack of scientific literacy.
124149619252_10152782064749253:Since I can't freely comment I wanted to thank Chipolte for now offering tofu in Florida!!!!! Woooo Hoooo!!!!!!!!!!! ???????????? https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10152759844246250&substory_index=0&id=75511806249
124149619252_10151089035244253:I love chipotle by none of the locations by me are my favorite. I have to wait in line for 30 minutes just to get my food. It doesnt stop me from eating there tho =) I would eat there more often if I didnt have to wait.
124149619252_10153896327714253:I sincerely hope everything gets better in the sanitation department. You have a good product, you just need to temp it correctly & keep everything in the restaurant CLEAN!!
124149619252_10152325977227741:GO GO GO CHIPOTLE  we are so proud in our house to see that you are leading the way to better food in the mainstream market place thank you for your integrity and thank you for having us as a part of your family...Proud wife of future restaurantur in the house folks!!!!!!
124149619252_10152322736529253:SO PROUD to know that we own a part of this company!!! Fall in LOVE with Chipotle Mexican Grill more and more all the time!! =)
124149619252_10151486609219253:White rice, Black beans, medium salsa, cheese, sour cream, guacamole with tabasco. I've always wondered if anyone else gets what I get.
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken rice, pepper& onions, lettuce, pico de gallo, some salsa on a whole wheat tortilla, chips & guacc on the side w/a sparkling flavored water. Yum!~
124149619252_10153009001449253:Sofritas.. Tofu doesnt sound appetizing to me! Carrie Wisehart have you ever tried that? I'm a chicken or barbacoa girl ????
124149619252_10151906029579253:It's less than half price and if you think that the money if going to a great cause. All the employee works the extra miles for costumers . If you can eat two times just get back on the line nobody's will notice.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Mary Nguyen, Maryann Tran, Phong Minh Nguyen, Quynh Mi Nguyen Lam, Michael Tran, Chris Council, Jimmy Nguyen,
124149619252_10152379465819253:Yeh, the show your bike crowd is going to love being welcomed by this, when that event comes to Dallas.
124149619252_10153734396969253:I think the reason for their ecoli problem is their nasty servers. When I stand in line to buy food it's insane the unsanitary things I see... like servers talking over food; pots and containers dripping water in the food; cleaning of the counters with gloves which they then go back and grab customers food to serve with... I've even seen a server sweeping and then back to serving food...ugh,  I stopped buying food there eventually. My stomach isn't strong enuh
124149619252_178542422170361:Its funny, cuz whre i live in florida i can think of like 4 chipotle's in my area. I've eaten there so much, I've become sick of them
124149619252_10151024826814253:brown rice, black beans, fajita veggies, mild medium AND hot salsa, corn, sour cream, cheese, guacamole, lettuce, and extra cilantro!
124149619252_181086415246015:I can smell chipotle from across the street right now, I'm at wok and I don't get breaks.... This Is Torture. (0_0)
124149619252_10151258924194253:I used to have to work every thanksgiving because I worked at a grocery store. They called it the "butter run", people come in for the one ore two ingredients they forgot or didn't get enough of. I didn't mind I was paid 2.5 times my usual pay and the customers are usually really nice that day. I was done by 2pm with family or friends by 3 :) kinda miss it actually.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken fajita burrito: white rice, peppers and onions, tomatoes, a lot of hot salsa, corn, cheese, and lettuce
124149619252_10152093036984253:Glad to see you are closed.  I wish all businesses closed.  Its bad enough that Doctors, Nurses, Police and Fire (and other important careers) have to work....the unnecessary businesses should not be open.  Merry Christmas!!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Correction there is such a thing as a free meal and free burrito. .its called someone else paying for it lol
124149619252_10153246130479253:Love what you have done eliminating GMOs  Will reward you by eating at your restaurants, often, very often.
124149619252_454413931302356:Donna, why do you think the boy scouts can do what they want, but it's discrimination when Chipotle does what they want?  Wow, what a hypocrite you are.
124149619252_10153389325099253:Would love to eat Chipotle closer to home in Covington/Conyers ga instead of having to drive all the way to Snellville.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl- white rice, steak, pinto beans, tomato salsa, hot red chile sauce, cheese, and guacamole. Boom! 
124149619252_267832333301923:I know this sounds crazy, but I'm pretty sure supporting your local farmers markets, buying fruit, milk, eggs, and cheese from local farmers supports them the same. Even at a better price than that lunch bag. I could get 6 days worth of fruit and veggies from a local farm for that price. 
124149619252_10151719407409253:You have to make sure that all of the words are correct and you don't use the same word on the drop down lists twice before the submit button lights up and you can click on it. If you still have a grayed out submit button, you have something wrong in the puzzle. I'm on a Mac using Safari and it took me almost 10 minutes to get the puzzle done and it never logged me out.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Garrett thanks! God forbid I actually go into a chipotle. Even worse with a fake coupon.... I couldn't deal with the social anxiety that would follow.
124149619252_10151486609219253:A burrito with white rice, no beans, half chicken,half steak, a little bit of hot, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce. With some chips
124149619252_10150300340834253:you should probably tell your web guys that they should turn of HTTP access until the site is ready! http://shophousekitchen.com/
124149619252_10151089035244253:I love the Lakewood, CO location right off of Union Blvd. The ingredients are always fresh, the service is always fast, and the employees make the experience one to repeat...and repeat, and repeat, and repeat :D Seriously, this place is on my Top 10 Things I Miss in Colorado list. P.S. When is the Elmwood, LA location opening?
124149619252_10151089035244253:83rd ave & Peoria Peoria az!  The young lady who is at the tortillas around lunch time (tall, thin, Caucasian , with a tattoo on her forarm...   she is so friendly & has such a nice smile. I so appreciate being greeted so warmly!
124149619252_10152560126959253:Anne van Gent! I haven't even been to Chipotle since the three of you left--it's too sad! The association is cemented in my brain.
124149619252_10153405438314253:I live in Baltimore Maryland and my daughter who is 2 years old love chipotle so much she made a song about it.. I would love to share it but can't seem to upload it.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl with white cilantro rice, black beans (pinto has pork/ewww) shredded beef, a LOT of hot salsa and double cheese! Ill be getting one tomorrow actually! Yummmmmm
124149619252_10152949800154253:We hardly ever eat at Chipotle any more. The lines are into the dining room and it takes forever to get through them.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak fajita, white rice, black beans, extra sour cream and cheese. It's hard to wrap but not hard to eat.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Dear chipotle,  Please put a store in Williamsport, PA.  I moved and I miss you terribly!  Oh, your burritos and bowls are so yummy!  I need them!   Sincerely,  Liz
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak fajita burrito with black beans and chees mild and guac! Delicious my mouth wants one right now but I have to drive an hour for it:(
124149619252_10153246130479253:Chelsea Aston Newcomer I know you have seen this, but I just wanted to say I didn't think I could love chipotle anymore????????
124149619252_10153185651299253:Let's open 1 of these in the Conyers, Covington, Decatur, Lithonia, Stone Mountain. That's georgiaraisedbaby.
124149619252_145246312263952:I check in at my local chipotle so often I stole the mayorship yesterday, but still no hint of the special badge (even though they had a sign up talking about it)...  What gives?
124149619252_10152379465819253:Shaheen I'm really sorry that we weren't up to part with what you're used to. I'll be sure to share this with the restaurant so we can address your concerns. -Candice
124149619252_10152250518069253:well that is just too sad maybe chipotle should at least honor something since it is going around like wild fire :( very disappointed
124149619252_10152996855759253:Thank you Chipotle!  Thank you for having morals and holding your vendors accountable. You are setting a fine example!
124149619252_10151906029579253:This is why we can't have nice things! $3 for something I got free for years?! Go home chipotle your drunk!
124149619252_199537401806:Bring the Burrito to Joliet, IL. If you open a Chipotle within walking distance of my house, I can assure you I will cover the operating cost single-mouthedly. Any other customers would be pure profit! :-)
124149619252_10153009001449253:I went out in the Snowpocalypse and took the subway to another neighborhood JUST for this promotion. I waited in line for 10 minutes at around 4pm. When I got to the front of the line and ordered they told me they were out. So I spent $5 bucks and an hour of my day for nothing. Annoyed. #SofritasMonday #fail.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Half carnitas, Half barbacoa burrito with pinto beans, white rice, pico and corn salsas, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole. Mmmm.
124149619252_10151089035244253:Unfortunately there aren't ANY near me on the Mississippi gulf coast :(. The Blue Springs, MO that was 5 min from my old house was awesome!!!
124149619252_159372559415:When When I Visited Adam We Stopped @ Chipotle in Both Austin Texas & Back In Orlando !! It's Around.....& Very Fillin' !!!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Tottenham Court Road, London, England! There needs to be one nearer to all the American military base up north though.
124149619252_10151556916969253:Guillaume, we don't deliver outside of the US currently, sorry. And Jacqueline... oh Jacqueline. - Joe
124149619252_10152632602189253:Babe!!!!! Look!!!!! Hugh O'Brien Jr. and Monique Booth can you make me cake like the one in this post!!!! Please!!!! Lml.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Double wrapped, steak, black beans, white rice, hot salsa, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, and guacamole burrito
124149619252_10153009001449253:How about you just give me some bacon with it then I'll try it. Oh wait....that's right. Y'all are spineless
124149619252_10152935096524253:They are very generous in Frederick county, MD with the Guac. I'm always very happy with my experiences!
124149619252_10153608850569253:My wife used to LOVE this place but now she is very disported in it her family was in town for her birthday so I took them all out and they were soooooo rude and got everyones order wrong even the manager was rude we will never go back there again
124149619252_10151024826814253:Ok, you helped me decide... this is what I'm having for lunch today: Steak bowl, white rice, black beans, pico de gallo, cheese, lettuce!
124149619252_10152927494854253:Just found 6 pieces of avocado husk in my guacamole at CHIPOTLE.   They increased the price of guacamole and then decrease quality...HORRIBLE!  This chain is going down the drain. SHARE this with I everyone please!! #chipotle
124149619252_10151520750889253:Ugh sorry Amber Determan. Looks like you gave Chipotle up for the Lenten season + 1 day. No chips in your Easter basket!
124149619252_183772721660585:Love Chipotle, great food, great mission. I go out of my way to eat there. One request, loose the GMO soybean oil that you cook in and the place would be perfect.
124149619252_10152990683604253:Tinley park location sucks! Everyone I'm in there... Have to wait for kitchen help to prepare rice steak or barbacoa... In the meantime all of the help is discussing there personal lives. Not just on one occasion ... But several occasions. Never going back to Chipolte
124149619252_10153246130479253:So...no more corn or rice ever? Unless y'all are getting some really rare specific strains, I'm pretty sure most strains are GMO in some way.
124149619252_10152250518069253:If you think their social media people are busy debunking this, just imagine the hell that store workers are going through, explaining over and over that the coupon's a hoax.  Whoever made the original image worked at it - they even used a font that resembled the company. It's sad that someone would go to such lengths to cause unnecessary hassle for a company. It's not even a statement kinda thing...it's just trolling..
124149619252_10153602183249253:The wheat used for your tortillas is in fact gmo. There's nothing wrong with gmo. It's responsible for the reduction in starvation around the world.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken salad bowl - light lettuce, fajita veggies, double chicken, mild salsa, guacamole, dressing ... heaven
124149619252_454413931302356:If I agree or disagree with any policy, I enjoy when a company has the fortitude to stick to their principles. Frankly the only principle I care when determining where I eat however  is do they made some damn good food and is it healthy for my son and I?  Chipolte sure does that.
124149619252_10151058843154253:Its that sexy design. Everybody there rubbing their crotch on the glass creates enough heat to cook the food and the static electricity powers the lights and everything else.
124149619252_156053474470:i dont even know if there's a chipoltle near me. its pretty gay becasue it is my very fave and now that there's chipoltiway i can eat it when ever i want
124149619252_10152407734029253:Thank you Chipotle for Mc Donaldlizing my favorite taco shop. No Mexican literature on those cups? That's okay, this gives 7-11 a corner on the market. Octavio Paz on my 32 ounces of Horcata Slurpee to read while I eat my bag of Nacho cheese Doritos and contemplate Mi Vida Loca.
124149619252_10150300340834253:The shophouse.com website doesn't seem like it's ready for the public yet, but it does go directly to their file folder, and you can watch this random video... http://shophousekitchen.com/_IMG_1780.MOV
124149619252_10153246130479253:Does this mean no more corn products? Because corn is a product of selectively modifying the genes of the plants. Kind of like how wolves became dogs. Which is very clumsy as far as genetic alteration goes.
124149619252_10153806089609253:I just ordered chipotle for the first time in months after the whole ecoli situation, and read online that they're cutting back on portion sizes for the SAME price, after I realized my burrito with extra toppings was the size of a baked potato. This is ridiculous. This is not a good move on their part at all and I hope they lose fans and I will definitely be ordering hot head burritos for now on
124149619252_182409608462105:Hey Everyone New Chipotles to come.....Just heard they will be opening Chipotles in Kansas, Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma,& Nebraska.....Yay!!! :D
124149619252_10151024826814253:Easy. Chicken burrito with white rice, pinto beans, two scoops of the hot salsa with cheese, sour cream and lettuce. 
124149619252_10153656854824253:Put less cilantro and red onion!!!! Tastes like cilantro sauce. So I make my own when I get Chipotle instead of paying for it there...
124149619252_10152250518069253:I haven't had one in a while.. i want pizza i never crave pizza but i want one to my self no sharing Ariela Melchor
124149619252_10152250518069253:I can't believe any of you would be foolish enough to believe this. What's more ignorant is a lot of you want them to give you free food. They're a business. Not a charity. If you don't like it, don't eat there. I have a hunch that losing a bunch of cheap, freeloading customers isn't going to hurt their business.
124149619252_10150959152619253:Not here in Tulsa, OK. You guys really need t get another restaurant here in mid-town. The one on 15th and the one on 71st are too far away!
124149619252_10152935096524253:Austin Wyatt the guac servings are that size, sometimes bigger, at least in my area they are. I know it varies by location. My Chipotle burritos end up weighing like a pound and a half by the time I'm done ordering...lol
124149619252_10151486609219253:Burrito Bowl: White Rice, Pinto Beans, Steak, Chili Corn Salsa, Sour Cream, Extra Cheese, Guacamole, Lettuce and Two Tortillas on side! Yummmmmmy!
124149619252_365284166822162:@Mike...me too on the chicken...I have just switched to the vege bowl with the guac...no way will I give up Chipotle : )
124149619252_341532579201452:Daniel, this particular promotion is not available either through our iPhone app or through our as yet non-existent Android app, although we are building one this year. Please check out the offer above and how to do it, when you are able. Thanks! - Joe
124149619252_10151089035244253:Glenview, IL I don't know what the hell they do but they are better than any of the others I've had. marinated and cooked perfectly.... Recently they have been making smaller burritos tho. :(
124149619252_155304234532263:Why aren't the burritos shaped like burritos anymore? I always get this rectangle shape,and they ALWAYS are out of shredded pork? I'm bout done with the mcdonalds version of mexican food.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl, brown rice, fajita veggies, extra chicken, mild tomato salsa, corn salsa, lettuce, cheese, sour cream..... #delish!
124149619252_10153009001449253:I was surprised... Its REALLY good!!!! Its like ground beef with yummy spicey flavor. Not mushy or sponge-like at all
124149619252_10153246130479253:Yet they still sell softdrinks with GMO sweetners in them in their stores.  Its a marketing ploy people.  Simple makrketing
124149619252_10150959152619253:Dulles - right downstairs from the Admiral' Club. I have a co-worker that eats there every time we fly out.
124149619252_10153009001449253:One store in our area is out.  The other gave so little sofritas that it defeats the purpose of trying to get people to TRY it bc I tasted none of it.  Boo. I even asked for more and I probably got a teaspoon more, at most.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Are there any vegetarians in Chicago? We can swap. This way you have two sofritas and I will have the two other choices.
124149619252_10152632602189253:I Love you Chipotle.  Please consult with the guy that ate nothing but Chipotle for 30 days and set up a Chipotle Mexican Grill diet plan for your fans that want to eat you every day but also want to loose a little weight.  PLEEEAASSSEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!
124149619252_10152805746454253:Extra white rice, pinto beans, barbacoa with double steak, light sour cream and a lot of cheese. Sometimes double wrapped with a soda
124149619252_10152250518069253:This one might be a hoax...but remember on Halloween you basically had half off if people showed up in costume.
124149619252_10151251776579253:I LOVE SOME CHIPOTLE! BUT I HAVE 2 GO SO FAR 2 GET IT.  TO CHIPOTLE POWERS THAT B  PLEASE PLEASE CAN'T  YALL PUT ONE IN THE HOOD? I live on StClair
124149619252_10153521011509253:I have kinda been turned off of chipotle.  Open a store in my area and higher people who dont want to do there jobs so that you get cold food all the time. Haven't been back since
124149619252_159372559415:There's Chipotle in Boston? Really? A few years ago when I went for a visit there wernt any, and my friend went through withdrawls, and had to hit up our local Chipotle when we got back to town...I'm serious.
124149619252_10153310575624253:Kay Holcomb Eric Forsyth Amanda Gass we should look into this. Free is good and Portugal the man is better.
124149619252_10151258924194253:Leftover turkey would make a good burrito. If that's not an option, a delicious barbacoa will suffice. Happy Thanksgiving!
124149619252_10151149863494253:I used to live in the USA for one year and one one the things I miss in my life is Chipotle !!!! Bring one of your stores to Brasil !!!!!
124149619252_10153736393409253:http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/college/vegas-isn-betting-boston-college-chipotle-article-1.2460079
124149619252_199537401806:Wisconsin or Upper Peninsula of Michigan, I have to drive all the way to Minneapolis for my burritos right now
124149619252_10151520750889253:This is one of the many reasons I LOVE Chipotle.  The food is addictive and delicious.  But they have morals in a day and age when no one else seems to.  You eat good quality food when you eat there.  Meat that wasn't abused and fed hormones and whatnot.  And staff is treated like human beings.  Thank you Chipotle!  I want a burrito now....dang it.  lol.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Yup. Thought I was smart ordering and paying online for my coworker and me. Get there and wait in the order pickup line for over 40 minutes. As soon as I get to the head of the line, they tell me they're out of sofritas and ask if I want to substitute for veggie or chicken. I say veggie for both. They ended up giving my order veggies and my coworker's chicken. The manager at 316 N Michigan in Chicago really needs to staff more people. All the employees are running around like crazy even on non-promo days. Insane.
124149619252_182078509223:Not enough MEAT. COME ON PUT SOME BABY SEAL BLUBBER and GRINDED CHICKEN IN THERE so I can walk in with my leather jacket and bearskin rug cape and tick off all these PETA-sympathizing morons. BEEEEEEEEF
124149619252_10151024826814253:white rice, black beans, barbacoa, hot, extra sour cream, cheese, lettuce and guacamole......is it sad that when i go into a larger town my first choice is chipotle? bring one to sebring, fl please
124149619252_10152693491999253:Does this mean that Chipotle will be removing all soda fountains and any other items with added sugar from their stores?
124149619252_140837186009517:Great job on this!  I love Chipotle, Willie Nelson and Coldplay so was is there not to love about this??  Thank you for continuing to get that message out there.
124149619252_10152407734029253:I guess I wont  miss what I never tried .I hope you all think it was worth losing money over. Not one I would  bank on. You showed you true colors. I don't like the color yellow...
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak bowl ,extra steak, extra rice, lots of cheese and hot salsa! Can't forget the chips and salsa with a tortilla on the side to roll up mini burritos. :)
124149619252_10151961054499253:I try to eat at Chipotle at least 2 or 3 times a week. Everyone in my family absolutely loves how good everything tastes!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie burrito with brown rice, black and pinto beans, mild and corn salsa, sour cream, cheese and guac :)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa beef bowl, brown rice, black beans, fajita veggies, pico, medium salsa, cheese, sour cream and lettuce...yummm!
124149619252_10153246130479253:A great move.  But I would be really impressed if you would get rid of corn syrup and artificial sweetners from the soda.
124149619252_205082546217004:OMnom nom nom nom I <3 me some Chipotle! It is in fact where I go when I want something fast and relatively healthy.  (Just take half of it home or you'll get all your delicious calories for the day in one meal!)
124149619252_10153246130479253:I think that the people's are waking up::;; I have been saying it for years   Now let's work with  Poultry /eggs  Beef/ milk Porks Fruits and vegetables  Every food that we consume they all are based with  hormones and steroids  If you want to eat safe you must eat organic food they cost a little more but you will be feeding your family chemicals FREE
124149619252_10153569576059253:You guys came out of nowhere years ago and now all the fast food chains are shaking in their burger shoes!!  Taco Bell is still amazing though if I don't want to spend twice the money haha
124149619252_10152881169974253:We did it last night for my birthday for 25 people. We ran out of veggies and almost ran out of meat. Had lots of beans leftover but we mixed all the hot ingredients together to eat as leftovers. I'd also suggest keeping a close eye on the sternos. Our rice dried out pretty quickly
124149619252_10151258924194253:I will always try to find a chipotle to eat at ...wish there were some closer bit that's ok....love your judo.was practice!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Highland Square, Akron.  Way better than the normal strip mall location - front plaza usually has people hanging out or skateboarding or musicians playing.  It's is directly across from the Highland Theater with its old school BRIGHT marquee - fun location to be at summer nights.  Good foot traffic, great neighborhood.  And the Chipotle Birds(tm) swoop down from trees at nearby apartment buildings and eat your chips and hang out at your table.  Hands down my favorite Chipotle location.
124149619252_10151961054499253:LOVE Chipotle they were my sons FIRST experience at a "fast food" restaurant when he was young and than my daughters when she came along. Both my children are now 7 and 10 and when they are hungry and want something quick to eat Chipotle is what they ask for!! neither of them like McDonalds (I am so happy for this) and the people are so understanding when I ask for particular things on the kids taco plate. My daughter doesn't eat meat so she is particular what she wants and my son loves meat, But the staff are always so courteous. THANK YOU Chipotle you all are AWESOME. Now where do I get coupons I didn't know you had such a thing :)
124149619252_228303190552746:Bruce, it's a move-able dog fence, as Paul rotates his crops through the fields where the pigs are, so that they can fertilize the soil. It's not inhumane at all. I've stepped on it myself.  - Joe
124149619252_10153246130479253:Very misleading - "...nothing sold by Chipotle will contain any genetically modified ingredients" In order for this to be true they'd have to stop selling meat. The animals they use to supply their meat are fed GMO feed, making that meat anything but GMO. It's a great step forward but this headline is misleading.
124149619252_10152676820799253:Chipotle Mexican Grill, will you guys expand to franchises around the United States? I haven't had pizza like this I left my hometown in Italy.  it's so hard to find a pizzeria that even comes close to this in North West Ohio :( I need la pizza vera! E Napolitana!!
124149619252_10153624802079253:Chipotle should change the name of their products what I'm seeing on this picture, THE PEOPLE WHO INVENTED THE TACO AND MADE IT FAMOUS FOR THE WHOLE WORLD CALL THIS : Tostadas , TOSTADAS,ADAS, ADASS, DAS, AS( echoes)
124149619252_156053474470:Chipotle delivered to my door would be heaven on earth... let's hope this works out for all Chipotle's throughout the US!
124149619252_10153246130479253:How expensive is organic cheese?? Lots of calf-killing if you choose not to use gmo cheese. Will PETA be offended??
124149619252_199537401806:Nolan, I feel your pain!!!  We moved from Columbus Oh to Pearl Mississippi, and there is NO Chipotle out here!!!  We have to go "home" to get a burrito!!  Please...bring one out here!!!!
124149619252_284976561592270:this is a cool promotion but you can check in anywhere anytime if you wanted to even if you werent anywhere near a chipotle
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl with a tort on the side... white rice... half chicken half steak... fajitaa. Tomatoe corn sour cream cheese lettuce... hot sauce on the side... h bommbbb
124149619252_127768177287696:Could you PLEASE ask Santa to drop us off some burritos in Mobile, AL?  Closest Chipotle is 4 hours away and we miss them!
124149619252_10151534588344253:Chrizanna, we're sorry you have had disappointing experiences at our Polaris restaurant of late. However, if you'd like to call our restaurant again, I just called our folks there, and our people answered immediately (we do have two numbers listed on our website: one is phone and one is fax). And in the meantime, we'll definitely work with our people to ensure our food is always hot, excellent, and delicious for the future! Thanks for sharing your concerns, so that we can get these things fixed. - Joe
124149619252_10153872104594253:went to chipotle yesterday & decided to get a burrito - suddenly when I bit into the burrito i saw something interesting -steam was rising out of the rice, beans & chicken portion. the chicken was juicy & seasoned with flavor - this made me curious, so i took another bite to discover the flavor of rich salsa, corn &  cheese. this interesting experience took me by surprise so i felt compelled to come here & voice my concerns.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Lol, all these people talking smack about Chipotle, but yet they take the time to visit the page. Go eat Taco Bell, trolls.
124149619252_10150256700954253:Heck Yes!! Happy Birthday! You are my favorite place to eat, seriously!! In fact, I am eating your chips and hot salsa right now. BTW I love your salty, limey chips - nobody does them better! In case you haven't figrued it out by now...I Love You, Chipotle. : )
124149619252_10153693560944253:I was a fan of chipotle and more of the open kitchen environment until I saw two incidents that really made me wonder 1) walking by before opening I saw a guy dropping a pan full of cut peppers he looked every where to see if anyone was watching and started to pick up the peppers and put them back into the pan and continued his way to the kitchen.  2). Stand in line look at the guys and managers touching their faces scratching their heads wiping their hand on the aprons all these are causes of cross contamination a lot of the locations don't have all their certificates posted or current or don't have them at all, Massachusetts stores are just not clean
124149619252_363324750372027:Im so frustrated with you guys! I have emailed multiple time telling you and even explaining how much opportunity you are missing out on by not opening a Chipotle here. Everyone else is but you guys aren't. I miss Chipotle so get with the program. Lol
124149619252_10152262999499253:had a sofritas burrito last night, for the first time! It was so good and had just the right level of spice and heat!!!!
124149619252_10150260445594253:You were at Veggie U?  It's a very cool place - right outside Milan, OH!  My aunt lives across the street!  I hope you had a great time!
124149619252_10153246130479253:That's awesome but I hope they understand that corn didn't look that way a hundred years ago, pigs started as boars and jalapeños had to come from somewhere.   Nothing we eat hasn't been genetically modified in some fashion whether through evolution or selective breeding.  I get it.   Monsanto bad but seriously,  the scare factor of "genetically modified" is wearing off.
124149619252_10153232136249253:Where does your beef and chicken come from?? And why not get local meat not all pig farms raise large amounts??? You heard of supporting your local farmers to get them to patronize your stores???
124149619252_10152406485254253:Lol at the people who said they will never eat at Chipotle anymore. Maybe now, the line won't be as long :)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl, lime rice, double fajita veg, double steak, double mild salsa, sour cream, double guacamole, & cheese!!! Now that's a meal fit for a god!
124149619252_10151037650024253:Aww. I see you had to post a different picture. Fabulous though! If I can recall, chipotle pepper extract is in the spicy-pepper adobo marinade that the steak and chicken grilled with. That same adobo marinade is also in the chipotle-honey-vinagrette dressing that is my all time favorite! I love you Chipotle, especially after working with you for 5 years during college. I am still an extremley avid Chipotle-goer...and having it tonight! :-)
124149619252_266206333465511:I had over 500 checkins 2 yrs ago... i quit cuz --why?  chipotle just needs a stamp card with a free burrito every 10.

124149619252_10152840149194253:I just sat down on Southwest 3776 from Baltimore to Cleveland.  I brought a whole burrito with me.  I finished it before we were done boarding.    So good!
124149619252_10153262094399253:Chipotle Mexican Grill makes the best Guac!  Couldn't wait to make it - went and had lunch there today with Kati Beth!
124149619252_100780796665922:Qdoba is just plain gross. I'll take Chipotle before that and even Freebirds before even touching Qdoba!
124149619252_267832333301923:Me and my husband can go to Chipotle for lunch and get the whole shebang for the price of 1 of those. :P 
124149619252_10153431912459253:The closest Chipotle is an hour away from me. I love "Mexican Food" and some food products that pass as Mexican food these days, but if I am driving an hour to get something to eat it is going to be 5 Guys. Maybe if you didn't keep raising prices, and quac didn't cost another 25% of the product total I would consider it over 5 Guys, but probably not.
124149619252_10153034270734253:My only complaint with Chipotle is that their Meat is always ice cold so the burritos are always cold. I got a Steak burrito yesterday, I take them home just so I can put in the oven so I can eat a warm burrito, and still when I bite into the burrito the steak is like little cold bites of meat! Totally sucks and that is why I will stick with Currito.
124149619252_10152949800154253:This was super disappointing to me. Fighting off a nasty cold and wanted some comfort food. Sent the hubby out for Chipotle and get a text that you are closed. ???? had to find an alternative. Went with one of your competitors. Next year you should consider staying open on New Year's Day....
124149619252_10152935096524253:If only they made em that fat...these kids in texas dont know how to make burritos like that! Half a spoon of everything...psh! #iminlovewithchipotle
124149619252_10150260445594253:Chipotle should open a new location in Gaffney S.C. they would make a killing here cause the closes one is alittle over an hour away and so many people say how much they enjoy Chipotles fine food but the drive is to far and I agree
124149619252_10151058843154253:Awesome... proving once and for all a business can survive and thrive on green energy and local produce.    Keep rocking Chipotle!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito. Rice no beans. Steak. Mild and medium sauce. Sour cream, extra cheese.. extra! Dont forget the guac. <3
124149619252_10152406485254253:Congrats.  Way to lose over half the country to a stupid move.  Protip: if it's concealed you won't see it anyway
124149619252_454413931302356:The idea that I can eat at Chipotle and not have to look at people like Joe Mellon while Im eating is appealing indeed. I just discovered Chipotle where I live, but now I have good reasons to return - post haste!
124149619252_10150942028479253:Chipotle is my favorite restaurant of ALL time, but you guys SERIOUSLY need to up the spice. Like add another level or two on top of that.   -The Spice Fiend
124149619252_205455487672:YEAH! You can go to Europe but not St. george Utah! What the ffff! I'm eating left over chipotle chips and salsa from salt lake utah right now. if only they were fresh.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Ate there today.  Chicken burrito bowl with rice, all the salsas, sour cream, guac, cheese, lots of lettuce and green sauce. Chips and corn salsa, it's all good.  Spicy!!!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito, extra white rice, black beans, PIco, hot sauce, soure cream and cheese!!! :) The best thing in the world is chipotle! Thank you whoever invented it!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Guacamole, chicken, pico de gallo, lettuce, sour cream, cheese, black beans and cilantro and lime rice!
124149619252_182409608462105:I like contests a lot better when they aren't about how many friends you have on facebook.  Basically the more friends you have, the more likes you'll get... regardless of content.
124149619252_228303190552746:Our intention is never to disparage anyone or their practices, but rather to illustrate that there are differences in how farms operate and, as consumers, we all have choices to make when we decide what to eat. We have chosen to support more sustainable agricultural practices whenever we can. Folks can then make their own choices about what they eat and can do so based on whatever criteria they choose, as you are also welcome to do. - Joe
124149619252_10153302438484253:Let's open a Chipotle n the Conyers,Covington, Decatur, Lithonia, Stone Mountain area. That's Georgia baby. I live n Covington Ga, and the closest Chipotle is 40 minutes away n Snellville Ga.
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken burrito bowl with corn salsa, guacamole, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and boy is it delicious :)  Good job
124149619252_244957752262179:Please bring the truck to south Florida.  I've worked in many stores in many cities, and we've got a great following down here.  I really, really, really want to eat from the truck, even work on it.....and I'll make sure I bring contacts from cities far and wide...  I might even bring some of my organic lettuce I've been growing as an incentive to get down here!  Much love.
124149619252_180887498696:Didnt feel like cooking yesterday, so we went to Chipotle for dinner.  I am always impressed at how fresh and filling the food is.  Love it!
124149619252_10151892810414253:Will, So we can look into what you are experiencing, can you please send a message to our Customer Service Team: http://chip.tl/re0OLp? -Myra
124149619252_10151089035244253:How about putting a location in Clarksville, TN?  The closest one is Nashville and I miss my Chipotle!!!
124149619252_10151520750889253:Thank you for respecting the holiday and your employees and their families!!! There should be more companies like you!!!
124149619252_10152949800154253:Suggestion:  Find a way to speed up the lines during the dinner rush.  I don't know how many times I've seen people (myself included) walk out because they got tired of waiting in line.  Or just pull in the parking lot, saw the line through the window, and just kept going.  It's a line to a burrito place; not to a roller coaster at Cedar Point.  People shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes.  I could just stay at home and wait for pizza in the time it takes to drive to Chipotle and wait.
124149619252_10151086390274253:I can't even begin to imagine the delicious - ness of Chipotle in London. A taste of home! Go MMT and KW!
124149619252_142788962468209:Very interesting.  I wish there was more awareness with eating organic.  Your body loves you for it!!!!
124149619252_10151486609219253:white rice, chicken. black and pinto beans, hot sauce, corn salsa, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce. I'm really craving it right now!
124149619252_10152560126959253:Good tip: If you ask for double chicken or double meat, ask AFTER the first scoop is given, otherwise your scoops might be compromised. 
124149619252_10152990683604253:One of the very few places I can eat out vegan. Just finished my burrito bowl and it was so yummy!! ????

124149619252_162705813797304:Did anyone know that's there's a chipotle in LONDON.....I couldn't believe it..my sister just came back from a trip..n she took pictures of the place...its AMAZING.....
124149619252_100780796665922:Love qdoba! My family and I eat there at least once a week. There food is fresh and amazing! They also offer way more choices, the staff is alot friendlier, and they have coupons and incentive programs. We get free meals almost every time we go. 
124149619252_10153395310879253:If love wins then why is this thread filled with hate?  This is love: that while we were yet sinners,  Christ died for us.  Only Christ's sacrificial love wins.  He will come again to judge the living and the dead.

124149619252_284168885010421:I tried to check in to the Chipotle in Vegas on Sahara and Fort Apache and it didn't show up in foursquare.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Ashley! I tried looking for your comment earlier but by the time I tried looking for it a million other people commented... hence why i never responded lol What did u say?
124149619252_365284166822162:Well it's a good deal, but I would have to pass on this offer as it just isn't the same not being able to put what I want on them.
124149619252_10152323527922741:Seriously why attack oil also? Chipotle Mexican Grill why don't you have 100% off the grid stores with their own power supplies? Chipotle Mexican Grill why don't you grow locally and not import to the stores? You really have no room to try to trash oil. Also, it isn't like your food is that healthy.
124149619252_109031815838831:It's really too bad when people feel the need to come and leave negative comments under such a positive customer story. Oh well, Chipotle--you're awesome! And I LOVE all the rice in my burrito. Extra yum.
124149619252_10151185000424253:What about the dress like a burrito and get a free burrito? Your newest location is about to open in Perrysburg, Ohio and I heard that you guys do that.
124149619252_10152445209089253:This place is great for truck drivers. It's healthy and GMO-Free!!!!! I eat here, stay healthy and keep my weight down.
124149619252_10152250518069253:it got me to come to this page and it got me to like it while I was here. So what if there is no free burrito. It's not like we will stop eating this amazing crack like food. We still love you Chipotle!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Ask for a side dish with just brown beans and rice. Throw a bit of steak on top, and regular salsa. Nice little snack
124149619252_10153009001449253:No chipotle stop. First tell the centreville VA chipotle to stop undercooking the rice and add lime as it used to
124149619252_10153246130479253:I guess that does away with the corn salsa.  They will figure out another salsa to take its place, I hope.
124149619252_10151058843154253:I'm guessing that what makes it so special is the windmill on top of it which most likely supplies power to the store.  I'm also guessing that a good portion of the wind that turns it is supplied by the customers who ate bean burritos.  Quite an efficient model. :-P
124149619252_10152949800154253:You need to figure out how to fill phone orders and wait on customers in the store.   Just left after a 20 minute wait.  The line was only doing phone/internet orders.  No longer my favorite restaurant
124149619252_10153405438314253:I want to give a shout out to your location in Casa Grande AZ the manager Brennen is Amazing I was traveling through AZ on my way to Vegas we stopped and ate! 2 hrs later I discovered I left my purse! My heart fell to the pit of my stomach! But your great honest staff found my purse and is mailing it to me!!There amazing 10 for customer service and made a fan 4 life!!!!
124149619252_10151089035244253:135th and Metcalf in Overland Park Ks puts all the other chipotles to shame. I don't know what they do but their burritos have so much more flavor  than everyone else. I live next to the one on 119th and Roe but they don't even compare to the other one.
124149619252_185864848093833:Kelsey, you are a bit uninformed.  When an animal being raised "naturally" becomes sick and needs antibiotics it is given them, however, at this point it is removed from our stock.  Naturally raised, antibiotic free doesn't mean neglect and suffering.  As for your comments about conventional agriculture, yes these methods are not as efficand they are currently more expensive,  but they are also healthier and more ethical (yes, animals were placed below us in creation as a food source, but God placed us here as stewards, not to lay waste and pillage our resources for the sake of the almighty dollar).  People are realizing a number of the things (though ill agree, not all of the things the vegetarian/vegan types avoid are truly the problems they think they are) we've used in agriculture simply for the purpose of increasing production are maybe not the best things to ingest.  I'm by no means a vegan or vegetarian (and apologies to those who are, I'm more on the Tony Bourdain side of this) nor will I ever consider it, but I've become more informed about what I eat, and over processed food loaded with unnatural chemicals is not okay.
124149619252_10152323527922741:Are at chipotle today for first time. I havnt eaten so many cars in one sitting in a while,    But !!!     I liked it....
124149619252_10153734396969253:What humans have done to us chickens is SCARY!! You guys are crazy barbaric demons who breed us to eat us. For farm animals every day is like a scene from Saw.  http://www.mfablog.org/look-what-the-meat-industry-has-done-to-chickens
124149619252_10153555173409253:Always pride myself on being able to eat their burritos without losing any goodness to the tray paper... STARVE PAPER! STARVE!
124149619252_10153009001449253:I wonder if they'd make this into a bowl instead since I can't handle the flour /gluten tortilla. Looks delicious.
124149619252_105860719543628:what a sweet ad. :) can you please open a chipotle (or three) in Asheville Nc ? I will eat there every single day. - this is no joke
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl with rice, both beans, pico, medium salsa, cheese, and sour cream with chips and guacamole :-)
124149619252_10152250518069253:Sounds like a cheap publicity stunt that they didn't want to pay for. Who would take the time to do a hoax and even put an end date.
124149619252_10150959152619253:wow, if this is at an airport (Dulles) then every other chain restaurant in the United States needs to take lessons from Chipotle on how to do the chain thing in an airport. Normally, airport locations are embarrassingly inferior. But this looks awesome.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito.  White rice, steak, two scoops tomato, two scoops corn, one scoop hot, cheese.  Salsa monsoon.
124149619252_10153009001449253:We need this right now.   Trinidad in 3 weeks.   When we get bk we get the free one with all the land animals u want.  Lol
124149619252_492523374093310:Can't shake it I started when I was only 17 buy age 18 they knew my order when I walked in. CAN WE GET A FREQUENT BUYER CARD pretty PLease ??
124149619252_10151024826814253:Vegetarian salad with black beans, brown rice, grilled peppers & onions, fresh tomato salsa, corn salsa, guacamole, and No dressing!
124149619252_109031815838831:I love Chipotle, and I recently received outstanding customer service from you guys!  I submitted an issue through the "contact us" function on the website.  Not only did I receive a blindingly-fast reply, but the resolution greatly exceeded any expectations I may have had.  Don't change Chipotle, I love you!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Carnitas burrito white rice, corn salsa, cheese, lettuce, guacamole! With Tabasco chipotle hot sauce and a large sweet tea!
124149619252_167132760066216:The last spicy bite ....                                                                                Leaving my mouth wanting more. ....                                                     Chipotle I crave.....
124149619252_10153302438484253:He's quite an exceptional young man. Very well spoken, mature well beyond his years. Kudos to him for realizing his vision and for doing all he can to make it easy for others to follow in his footsteps. And kudos to chipotle for recognizing how extraordinary he is and fostering his growth.
124149619252_109031815838831:one of the Chipotle locations in my city had a deal going where every tuesday for an entire month healthcare workers who brought their hospital ID got a free burrito or bowl.  It was clearly the best month of my life :)  It was nice to feel appreciated, and to see that people appreciate the work we do.
124149619252_10152004082504253:Even if it was Spanish, wouldn't that be in line with the brand of serving mexican style food? Rocky, you're hilarious.
124149619252_454413931302356:@Chipotle Joe, I think what Ben is trying to say is that they were better people about it then your company is.
124149619252_10152174722794253:I feel sad for the cows, but hopefully your movie will create enough buzz to make a difference in the highly horrifying world of industrial ag. :/
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burritos bol, white rice, fajita veggies, steak, mild salsa, corn salsa, sour cream, cheese and occasionally, lettuce.  Yum, yum!  Now I want one!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Thank goodness there are not in the  Villages. Free food there will be a big old line. We could not near the front door.
124149619252_10151486609219253:Mine is POZOLE, rice, chicken, and cheese. and instead of a tortilla its in a bowl. Haven't had one in a while!
124149619252_10152453918534253:I wish Chipotle would have teamed up with Tokyo Joes to support another Denver based company and help bring it to the east coast! So glad I can have a taste of home where I live now though!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Wow Chipotle that's really sad. Yesterday IHOP gave out free pancakes to everyone that came in and they are still in business.  I am not too disappointed thought since your seasoning is not much more than an overdose of pepper.

124149619252_10153872104594253:I finally went back yesterday . haven't been since the first case. The food tasted different wasn't as seasoned, also I noticed the lemons are not there anymore.

124149619252_454413931302356:@ Tom Creedon - you have it all backwards.  It's these "religious" groups who have vile hatred for anybody who doesn't agree with their lifestyle.  That's why THEY are the ones who are trying to force everyone else, including those of us who are NOT members of their churches, to live by their religious rules.  Most of us don't care what these "religious" people do in their own lives.  We only care when they try to force us to live by their religious rules.  I know you likely won't see the difference, but that is the way it is.
124149619252_10152406485254253:I grew up with guns, I learned to hunt etc... but when you have strangers that you don't know walking into a business with kids and families.   How would they know what that strangers is there for?    I can't remember what town it was, but some guy came with a rifle to a little league game and it freaked the kids out.  They cancelled the games. Not sure why people feel the need to open and carry.   :/
124149619252_379758315393214:Darnit! I shouldn't have given my brother a check! I wonder if I can take it back and give a gift card instead?! I want a free burrito!

124149619252_10153246130479253:Good job Chipotle! Now if you would just make the burrito foil a bit thicker, it could be reused to keep out the government mind control rays.
124149619252_10151961054499253:We LOVE our chipotle and the entire team on Lake Mead in Las Vegas. Thanks for the great BOORITO special yesterday!

124149619252_164816057005566:I'm a diehard carnevour...but I've had the tofu...it's a little spicer than the steak...but doesn't taste like tofu at all! great new product.

124149619252_10153892196339253:Did anyone else see John Oliver's report on Sunday night about a bird flying inside a Chipotle (daily). The manager seemed to be okay with it. Unbelievable! Does Chipotle have any health code standards?
124149619252_10151024826814253:Vegetarian burrito..white AND brown rice, black AND pinto beans, lettuce, tomato, salsa, hot AND mild sauce, sour cream AND guacamole...oh and cheese!!!!!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Would have been a great promotion of the product if it wasn't sold out in the first 2 hours. (didn't get to try it) :(
124149619252_130482563683418:Just wish it was closer. Went to Moe's today because it was on the way home. I used to be strictly a Moe's fan until I discovered barbacoa burrito bowls.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Not buying tofu just to get a free burrito. I'll throw it away so it makes no sense. I'll just pay for one lol Kayla Clark
124149619252_240071849428248:Please build a Chipotle in Peoria, IL. You were supposed to but now it has been delayed. It would be unburritable if you could make this happen.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Chipotle promoted this event and then didn't prepare. Running out seems lame on a day like today. Sad family.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Hard shell chicken tacos with black beans, white rice, lettuce, cheese, pico, corn salsa, extra spicy salsa, guac, and chips! YUM!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Just ate this and it is fantastic!  Not as bad as I thought it would be. Might get it as my free one too!
124149619252_10152883474639253:I think its a scam to get likes and shares to make money, usally rich people dont give moeny away enless they made more money
124149619252_10153009001449253:All the stores around where I am closed early because of the snow. This offer should be extended as it seems like it didn't run to efficient
124149619252_10153246130479253:THANKS! Weren't you pretty close to that already? I think the soy oil you use at many restaurants was probably GMO, what else was before today?
124149619252_199537401806:Put Chipotle's in Canada!!  They need some real food up there!!  All my in-law's are up there and would love it!!
124149619252_130916887010628:This is what happens when Joe is no longer the owner of Davis Chipotle, no more incentive to go to Chipotle on Halloween.
124149619252_10152578960669253:So is it safe to say the winners of the Portland trip next week have already been notified? And I am not one of them? :)
124149619252_10151486609219253:White rice, black beans, peppers, hot sauce, corn, xtra sour cream, cheese, guac, lettuce, and a generous amount of chipotle tobasco sprinkled over the top.
124149619252_163075200578:We need kids meals MD!  And the Frederick location needs their alcohol license.  Been saying they're working on it since opening at least 5 years ago!  Hmmm... A request for alcohol and kids meals in the same comment.  Do kids drive one to drink? 
124149619252_10151486609219253:Chicken, white rice, black beans, cheese, and  sour cream. And two salsas! Because it's too difficult to pick just one. I must have the one with diced tomatoes and corn salsa. It makes my belly happy and full. <3
124149619252_10152250518069253:Hey Chipotle! Stop being mean over what you could EASILY turn into a profit being beneficial to your business! Stop using terms as "there's no such thing as a free lunch" as your demo caters to "sustainability" and the "green crowd". People don't like that "Soup Nazi 'tude you're posting her over coupons that for me, had been honored TWICE where I live in Amelia Ohio. Be the nice people you project and SAY you are... Oh...and I suggest you put something on your window on the beginning of your line so that people who HAVE NO MONEY, aren't embarrassed by your shovey attitude (JOE) when you tell them the coupon is a hoax.
124149619252_157777224183:thats awesome but i'd rather they take all the money they spend on solar and put it into a restaurant here in michigan i miss eating there. c'mon its not that cold in the winter.lol;
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak fajita bowl...brown rice, hot and mild salsa, a little cheese and sour cream, and of course a side of guac and chips.  Just had it for dinner tonight...awesome as usual!!!!
124149619252_10152250518069253:William Cole: Chipotle didn't start the hoax. Also, everyone: William Cole is going to give you a million dollars if you print out this comment. It is on the internet, so he is really going to, it's true. Now you have to do it, or you must be trying to kill your reputation if you don't. Sorry to hear, bro.
124149619252_10151486609219253:Brown rice, chicken, fajita veggies, roasted chili-corn salsa, fresh tomato salsa, and a little cheese
124149619252_10153872104594253:I love you, Chipotle Mexican Grill! I don't care what anyone says! Me & my dad have been meeting up for father/daughter lunches at Chipotle for YEARS. We're diehard Chipotle fans! <3
124149619252_10151024826814253:I'm kind of weird... Burrito, no meat, no beans, no rice, with lettuce and extra lettuce, red tomatoe salsa, guacamole, sour cream, cheese.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Gotta say I've never gone to Chipotle much in the past but due to you dropping GMOs I will definitely be eating more Chipotle as well as spreading the good word!  Way to go!!!  Love having a GMO free choice to eat out.
124149619252_130916887010628:Very excited about this.  My son has known since this summer that he wanted to be a farmer for Halloween so this event is just perfect.  Thanks for having such a fun event for such a good cause.
124149619252_109031815838831:Dear chipotle i love ur food but i. Is getting alittle old and i believe other customers are agrerin with me that u need to start adding different things to the menu thank you for reading this and please take this into consideration
124149619252_10152489832309253:Sire Onesixone, Chipotle is pretty up front about where their ingredients are sourced and what they contain. See their website here: http://www.chipotle.com/en-us/menu/ingredients_statement/ingredients_statement.aspx
124149619252_157777224183:Bring your solar over to california. We would appreciate it and we have plenty of sun. Love you guys, can't wait to get home and have some chipotle! 
124149619252_10152325977227741:I love you're restaurant!! Is there any way you could source you're corn and tortillas from Mexico since they are non gmo?
124149619252_10150262089049253:Any word on Fort Myers yet? There's an old Juicy Lucy for sale--perfect location--40k+ traffic per day (plus walking distance from my house!)
124149619252_10153395310879253:What I find stunning is that anyone is surprised by this. Chipotle has supported diversity from the start. Just another reason to love them.
124149619252_131676086962937:Inexplicably I don't, which is weird because I go to one in DT St. Paul MN 2-3 times a week and hold the mayorship. Oh well...
124149619252_10152853394299253:I took a picture but wasn't going to join  Twitter or Instagram just to participate in the contest. Really should have had a facebook option for submitting an entry.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl...white rice, black beans, chicken, salsa, cheese, lettuce & guac.  Same thing every time!
124149619252_213189592025031:someone wayyyy up there mentioned. God. I am not, if you notice, discerning your  view points in global warming or anything of that. I am discerning your thought of Earth Day being what you believe it to be. Clearly, you have no respect for where you live. And when that comes back for you, which it will, then it will be well earned. I see that the ignorance is far too thick for anything to get through but your own thoughts, yes, I did just call you the closed minded one incase you didnt catch that, and Im done here. I will be the mature one and walk away, seeing what kind of a world I get to continue to grow in makes me sad and hopeless. :(
124149619252_10152262999499253:I just had Sophritas Veggie Bowl in AZ today. It was really good. I don't eat much soy, but I highly recommend this! It did not taste like tofu. very seasoned & could be mistaken for minced chicken :)
124149619252_10151024826814253:I work next to a chipotle and I always get a chicken burrito, with extra white rice, green salsa, cheese, lettuce and corn! :)
124149619252_157777224183:waitn for the day when we can simply reach right into the screen and help ourselves to chipotle burrito
124149619252_10152786808474253:Rice, black beans, chicken,  fajita veggies, half pico, half medium, sour cream, cheese, easy lettuce and guac on the side, and a side of HOT. Can someone deliver!!
124149619252_10151626575004253:If only I hadn't already eaten, dang... btw, feel free to remind some of you Wi employees about this technique ;) lol
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken burrito:   rice, black beans, salsa, sour cream, extra extra cheese, hot hot salsa, a side of chips and a big ol coke....HEAVEN!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak/Chicken half and half burrito, black beans, ALL THE SALSA'S, lettuce, a dab of sour cream and cheese.. Nom nom nom!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Burrito Bowl: White Rice, Pinto Beans, Chicken, Medium Salsa, Sour Cream, Cheese, Extra Lettuce. Bag of Chips & a Medium Drink....DELICIOUS!
124149619252_10152406485254253:I had planned on trying Chipotle, not now. Glad I found out what kind of people you are before I spend my hard earned money there. Welcome To Moe's ;)
124149619252_10151024826814253:My favorite Chipotle burrito: carnitas, cilantro-lime rice, salsa and cheese. Chipotle needs to open in Anchorage, Alaska, too!
124149619252_109031815838831:I had Chipotle for lunch today. I love it and crave it.  I have gotten free chips and salsa and soda before for beign a regular.  Its nice when you are recognized and they know what you want to order already.  We lived in TN where there was not a Chipotle, drove to Atlanta and had some.  
124149619252_10152250518069253:^ Ruben Alexander Castro Ayala, Chipotle posted the GMO information to their webpage because they wanted people to be able to make informed decisions about the food people eat. Chipotle is working to eliminate GMO food from their menu, but non-GMO food is not currently available in quantities to satisfy Chipotle's needs. Almost every other restaurant uses GMO food and won't admit it.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Because it would be better for you to denounce an offer rather than counter with a LEGIT coupon and drive sales.. good plan marketing team. Good plan.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie burrito with white rice, black beans, the salsa w/ corn, sour cream, cheese, n guacamole...mmmmm :-)
124149619252_10153246130479253:Doubled up the prices now, a bowl was 7 bucks now it'll be 14, burritos will be $20 now. Sure it's healthier but the taste will decline as well as the amount of people buying, not everyone will have the $15+ dollars for one burrito. One of the reasons why Chipotle is so popular is because of its affordability, now quite a few customers will stop going there simply due to price. I'll still go there, it's my cheat meal on the weekends but hopefully the price doesn't skyrocket
124149619252_10153001213604253:Thank you for rejecting factory farms, for having awesome vegan food and for taking the pork out of your stores! Great news.
124149619252_284168885010421:I am totally a Groupie :) If I win free burritos for a year I will probably cry chipotle burrito sized tears of happiness haha
124149619252_213189592025031:Wow people...if you don't like earth day then ignore it. There's a lot more important things in life to put this much energy into. And let's face it, the people going after just wealth are gonna try to make profits off any and every holiday, and on the other hand there are people who want to make something good and special out of every holiday. So stop the arguing and go eat some Chipotle cause that's obviously one thing we can all agree is good :)
124149619252_10152560126959253:Fajita bowl, white rice, extra fajitas, steak, sour cream, mild pico de gallo, cheese, guac, lettuce and a double side of their salad dressing.   Yummy!
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito with steak no beans no rice pico de gallo lettuce and cheese two cups of pico de gallo on the side with a bag of chips :D

124149619252_10153547799644253:not as fun staying home inside the house with just the comp, and tv for fun acctivites ,plus occasional reading, just going out for fun is very little.
124149619252_10153246130479253:What's wrong with GMOs? Would love to hear from the people who are lauding this " achievement." Really.
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken burrito bowl - brown rice, black beans, fajita veg, medium, pico, cheese, sour cream and lettuce!

124149619252_10153001213604253:Shucks right now if I don't cut weight I'll be running as a chipotle burrito ???? who we kidding " walking".
124149619252_10152250518069253:But how were people supposed to know it was a hoax? They do offer free things from time to time! My daughter has been given free burritos for coming in with a uniform on, kissing some one on valentines day, etc,. So how are people supposed to sort the real from the fake?
124149619252_10151024826814253:steak or chicken Fajita burrito - with everything except for hot salsa, and yes, I know guac is extra; pile it on! :-)

124149619252_454413931302356:OMG what a HORRIBLE thing for a company to include political beliefs in what should be a food preparation business only.  I'm glad all us RIGHT thinking people can come together and also forgo (that means BAN for you TeaPublicans)*** Chik Fil A **** for dabbling in politics and religion.  HOW DARE THEY!  Its rather stupid to come here and complain when a company decides to make a stand you don't agree with, but support a company that makes a stand that you DO agree with, then have the audacity to complain that you're upset because the company is *taking a stand*.  BE FRIGGIN HONEST!  Just say "I won't be eating at your restaurant because I'm a Homophobe.'  Don't lie, don't be pretentious, don't put on airs.

124149619252_228303190552746:So great that your company does this and makes people aware! Hope that in the future the beef and chicken will be free range and pasture raised.
124149619252_10152935096524253:Glad I've never eaten at your restaurant. And after the respect your (sarcasm for lack thereof) to the first responders in nyc this past week I'll never eat there
124149619252_10151024826814253:bowl, white rice, pinto and black beans, chicken, red tomatillo salsa, corn salsa, guacomole, cheese, sour cream, lettuce.

124149619252_185864848093833:Ben Niblo, healthy is not defined by calorie content. High calorie meals dont make people fat, an excess consumption of calories on a constant basis creates and unhealthy situation. Wether there is 500, 200, 1200, 2000 calories in a meal, that is not what makes it unhealthy. The hand feeds the mouth, your in charge of wether or not you consume and EXCESS of calories or not.  Chipotle meals are fairly healthy for the most part. The food has no added preservatives, or overly processed ingredients. Is brown rice more nutritious then white rice? In terms of micronutrients, yes. In terms of macronutrients, no. The flour tortilla is it that bad? Not really.  When a meal is eaten as a whole (protein, fat, carbs) the theory" of the glycemic index is completely irrelevant.
124149619252_10150942028479253:This isn't the Myra from the 29th street chipotle is it?! I hope it is! You're absolutely adorable :)
124149619252_10153246130479253:Jeff Piety well to be accurate , there are only a few GMO crops grown in the u.s. , and the two used in chipotle are corn and soybeans (for tofu), both of which I didn't eat. But regardless of GMOs, chipotle still  ain't organic, and that's what they should really change.
124149619252_10150260445594253:Since I have a gluten allergy I can't have the burrito so I get the rice bowl. Since the first initial scoop of rice is very little I always ask for extra rice. Not once have I ever been charged for extra's. I can see if it's meat or guac.
124149619252_10151486609219253:Steak and carnitas (50/50), black beans, brown rice, chili corn salsa, cheese, sour cream, lettuce. It is glorious.
124149619252_10152394598154253:What's the joke flag Jennifer Gurley? The Gadsden flag? That flag is actually older than the American flag if you bother to read some history
124149619252_10153395310879253:There not serving pork anymore due to the muslims. So as not to offend them. I read a very offensive statement. Now im offended that i cant have a carnitas burrito
124149619252_10152996855759253:Is it true you took a stand on the abuse in factory farming.  And abuse? Before I share I needed to verify. I so hope it's true.
124149619252_10151908068909253:yeah, i remember it was $2 last year, it was pretty awesome seeing all the people come in though, I even saw a guy dressed up as Ace Ventura
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie burrito- brown rice, black beans, corn, green and hot salsa. Cheese, little sour cream, lettuce.
124149619252_10153498699374253:I had the worst experience at Chipotle yesterday. 3rd time getting old stale chips at this location and the worst bowl I've had there so far.
124149619252_355043257915416:Open in Washington,DC ...We love good Natural Food here! Im also going to chipotle for my Birthday instead of Red Lobster. ;-)
124149619252_10152805746454253:Steak (sometimes double when they want to be stingy!!!!) white rice, no beans, pico de gallo or mild, cheese, sour cream & lettuce nomnomnom
124149619252_346503142066549:I love Chipotle.  I have one about a mile away from my home.  I don't take it for granted.  I know how lucky I am!!!
124149619252_10151486609219253:Secret menu quesadilla burrito with brown rice black beans 1/2 steak 1/2 barbacoa (for the juice!) corn, mild and hot on the side! Wow!
124149619252_10150683592084253:send some over to germany for the soldiers :] and ill take 3 soft tacos with steak, lettus, cheese, and sour cream.
124149619252_10151024826814253:barbacoa crunchy tacos, corn salsa, spicy roasted tomato salsa I think that is what it is called, sour cream, lettuce, cheese and  lime n salt chips and guac for dessert LOL or a snack at home later  I DREAM about those tacos!
124149619252_10151053134024253:On the metro north train coming back from grand central.  Everyone in the train car was wishing they had one too...
124149619252_221129944611968:i still want a chipotle breakfast burritto, eggs, sausage or bacon, cheese  salsa  om nom nom nom  test market austin texas... make it so!
124149619252_228303190552746:Bruce, you seem very passionate about this topic. I do think, however, you may not seeing the big picture. Rather than saying this company is attacking this, or they are attacking them, instead ask yourself is synthetic hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, weed killers, and animal bi-product is what you want to eat and search your family. Of course the choice is yours as it is for everyone. Just seems, in my opinion, you could help spread the good Chipotle is doing instead of the negative. 
124149619252_10151089035244253:I got to go to the original Chipolte on evens last year it was awesome to go and tour it.  That is my fav but a close second is my home Edina Mn... Keep it up!
124149619252_10153009001449253:I heart you, Chipotle! Just think of how many lives you are saving by making a tasty non-cruelty burrito!
124149619252_10152054390879253:Grand Forks,Mn. The closest one is 5 hrs away and I know of a lot of college kids who would appreciate it! They have Qdoba and it just DOESN'T COMPARE!!
124149619252_10152883478794253:I love Chipotle. Strongly dislike their inaction on the issue. Unfortunately the food does not outweigh my moral convictions. Too bad too... Good food uneaten by the masses because of their own inaction. Awesome!
124149619252_10153498699374253:I would like to own me a Chipotle. I would be interested in opening one where I live in Covington Georgia.
124149619252_10151024826814253:steak burrito, no beans, rice, pico, corn, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, and cheese with a bag of tortilla chips, a side of guacamole, and a Bud Light. You guys need to open a store in Salina, KS!!!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Really disappointed in Chipotle. Went in to take advantage of this offer, waited in line for 20 minutes, only to be told they were out of sofritas. Told the manager they should put a sign out, but he had orders from headquarters not to. Not a good representation of The Brand, Chipotle!
124149619252_10152354297542741:Sure didn't! In fact, right after watching it I thought to myself: "I could really go for a burrito right about now!" And then, I proceeded to go get one!
124149619252_10153132892604253:Ok, so I love the guac, however, with the amount they gave me, they could have fed two people. Seriously they could have given me half the amount and only had to pay $1 instead of $2 on my chicken bowl.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito Bowl: Brown Rice, black beans, Fajita Onion & Peppers, Chicken, Pico De Gallo, Corn Salsa, Hot Salsa, lettuce, and cheese.
124149619252_10153152979994253:Ummmm so they keep quoting Joe Sophia Orozco lol.   I look forward to Chipotle posts now. Can you tell?
124149619252_100913656591677:BUILD ONE IN WILLS POINT I'M FREAKING DYING FOR CHIPOTLE AND I DONT WANT TO DRIVE AN HOUR TO GET SOME.
124149619252_10151486609219253:NOTHING cuz Chipotle hates me and won't move close to me. We have to drive 4 hours to have our anniversary dinner every year ;)
124149619252_10153236016399253:Beaverton,OR Chipotle sucks and so foes the Management.. There putting out poor quality food and the employees are disrespectful.....
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito with everything...all sauces, corn, peppers, guacamole... everything and chips! Yum!!!
124149619252_10152004082504253:Perhaps the fail was not stating this is a "seat saver". Honestly I've never paid attention to what was in the bag. I just know my oh so good food is in there. (Eyeroll)
124149619252_363324750372027:If you were in Augusta, GA...I would! Driving 1.5 hours for a burrito makes it hard.  wink wink....nudge nudge.
124149619252_10152949800154253:That's stupid, major loss of income everyone still gets hungry and when we're hungry we want Chipotle.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Loved reading Paolo's message on the brown paper bag while enjoying my Sofritas bowl. U guys r great!!
124149619252_10152406485254253:Oh, let me taste your tears. Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet!  Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy!
124149619252_365284166822162:Chipotle is only expensive because "everything" is natural! :)) the salsas they make, the meat, cheese, ect! Everything in the burito. So the price is worth it, When is food u can trust :-) 
124149619252_10153792851004253:Thanks to Chipotle for doing so much for our community. It is one of the most generous restaurant chains around.
124149619252_10153349214189253:http://abcnews.go.com/Business/chipotle-offer-part-time-workers-paid-vacation-sick/story?id=31619921  You guys rock. Loving the  non GMO too!!!
124149619252_10152406485254253:Mady Marantz When your family is in a restaurant and God forbid a killer walks in and some one manages to call 911 the police will only be minutes away when every second counts.
124149619252_10150959152619253:Dulles airport! The only reason I was able to have Chipotle last year in LA was to bring some home from my flight in VA. So excited to have it soon! :)
124149619252_166838126748689:And the first Albuquerque Chipotle Grill opens this weekend! I'll be there!  Thanks and welcome to the neighborhood!
124149619252_10153214785299253:We'll be serving up Mr. Pineapple, Devil's Ale, SunSpot Gold and HopShock IPA!! See you Saturday! Cheers!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl -white rice , black beans , half chicken half steak , medium salsa , chesse and lettuce ,,, sour cream and hot salsa on the side !!
124149619252_131676086962937:Cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese I want to steal some cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese
124149619252_10152406485254253:I love the idea of adding Cultivating Thoughts to your product surfaces and my family has enjoyed reading the to go bags, until this most recent one titled, "Two-Minute Romance" by M.T. Anderson.  It's hard to explain to my kids why someone would want to engage in speed dating and what it means to 'get lucky'!  I would have thought that Chipotle would have kept these Cultivating Thoughts more family-friendly.  Really disappointed. :(
124149619252_10152786808474253:Katie Markley Wojcicki, ask for more. I've never been turned down when I think it looks a little skimpy and I'm never charged extra. 
124149619252_10151089035244253:I have 2 favorites Mesquite, TX because it was my first experience with the awesomeness that is Chipotle.  And my 2nd favorite location is the Lewisville TX location (the one by best buy) the chicken is always fresh and not over cooked.  Chipotle I love your food and I'm still waiting on my rewards program.
124149619252_156053474470:I wish you guys catered. I am getting married soon and would love to have Chipotle for the reception.
124149619252_10153736393409253:I love my Chipotle! I have hung in while all the E.coli issues have continued. I am sorry to hear that another 8 cases were found in Boston now. As much as I love your food, I am going to "wait this out"  and put you on pause. Sorry.
124149619252_10153656854824253:I remember making it like this when I worked for Chipotle. It takes forever, but I think it's worth it. Chipotle is the only restaurant I've ever worked at that doesn't even have a freezer. Everything is fresh. I need one here!
124149619252_10152407734029253:Thank you Chipotle.......my family will be making more stops and telling all our friends of your great decision.......
124149619252_140229971715:lol. i'm sure this kids meal thing is gonna spread to all the chipotles eventually. in the meantime, they are probably going to do plenty of different promotions in different states. :)
124149619252_10153892196339253:Sounds like where I live! Lol no chipotle within 25 minutes! Sad! Imagine the business they'd have with ESPN close by!
124149619252_156053474470:Do you deliver to MA? :) :) :) :)  Good luck with the new service; I hope it works out so you can bring it to my town!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Still won't pay $10 for a fast burrito and a drink. Gtfo they used to be great. Now it's all rice burrito lol
124149619252_10153389325099253:Scottsdale AZ in the house....got at least 12 to choose from.  YES, that is why we are America's Most Livable City.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Technically there is.. Didn't you guys used to offer free burritos on Halloween for customers who wore tinfoil.........? That would be such a thing as a free burrito.. I agree, some sort of offer to seize the day would be nice!!
124149619252_10151089035244253:belmont and kenmore chicago IL  great managers great people  the averybody is awesome ilove this place
124149619252_10151307314369253:Thank you for having enough integrity to realise family is more important than money. If you were in my town, I'd visit your establishment at least once a week!
124149619252_261338423981855:There just needs to be a chipotle next to every mcdonalds, then I will be happy, as for I will never have trouble finding one again.
124149619252_10151089035244253:I always went to chipotle in Baltimore MD, two hours away but was  ecstatic to have one open right in Salisbury MD [20 minutes] !
124149619252_10153892196339253:the closest chipotle to me is philly which is 60 miles away and I usually take the bus or train there and stop by chipotle every time. takes me 4-5 hours to get there but the food is worth it. its my post or pre workout meal.
124149619252_10151024826814253:^then don't comment.. Or like their page. I get a burrito bowl chicken pico lettuce cheese sour cream brown rice and occasionally guac if I wanna pay for it haha.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl, white rice, black beans, peppers and onions, barbacoa and steak, hot and mild salsa, and cheese. AMAZING flavors!!
124149619252_205455487672:this is a smart move because English food sucks.  At least there will be something to eat next time I'm there!
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken burrito bowl...white rice, black beans, peppers and onions, extra hot salsa, little bit of sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.
124149619252_10151279478234253:chipotle my favorite fast food place! and they buy meat at the polyface farm where i buy mine also :)
124149619252_10152990683604253:Never knew chipotle used open field animals for meat ???????????? thank u chipotle!!! CHIPOTLE IS MY LIFE ????????
124149619252_10153888324619253:Just got my free burrito at the infamous Simi Valley Chipotle. I usually get barbacoa, but this time I got 1/2 barbacoa 1/2 steak. It was a wise decision since the barbacoa was all FAT...so only half of my burrito was ruined.
124149619252_10153009001449253:The 2 Chipotle near me ran out. At least they had a sign on the door but that was pretty lame. I saw ads for this promotion weeks ago so this should've been planned for. This was a nation wide problem apparently.
124149619252_155304234532263:Oh and i agree, why like a company to bash them. chipotle is the bomb and all the little hater comments wont matter. its a waste of ur hate! go hate something with other haters like urselves. www.hatersblog.org or something!
124149619252_10151024826814253:steak burrito: black beans, mild salsa, sour cream, cheese, white rice, lettuce, and guac. ahh..just absoulte perfection <3
124149619252_10152453918534253:If I could eat Chipotle every day for a year I would be so happy, and I would do it too. If only I could afford it and there was one closer than 40 miles! I drive out of my way to enjoy the delicious burrito's. A burrito from Chipotle currently costs me $14 because of the gas there and back :( Chipotle Mexican Grill you need to open a store in Owatonna, MN ((I will manage it even just for the discount!! Okay maybe I want to get paid too... but seriously!!))
124149619252_10150602702709253:After reading the "winning" Haikus, I think it's only fair that Chipotle should now go through the submissions and pick their 10 favorites because it's clear to me that some(well, most! LoL!!)of the judging was completely biased! Am I right? 
124149619252_10153240834269253:Chipotle is not doing this for any reason other than to profit off of the current GMO paranoia.  I will not eat here again.
124149619252_10152538683134253:I'll take it! Any chance we can get you to post the real recipe, with ingredient amounts? I'll still get it at Chipotle, too - can's get chips that good anywhere. :)
124149619252_454413931302356:Gonna miss my burrito  :(  Would have preferred that you keep your politics away from the company name.  Seems like a dumb move to me but it's your call.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl, chicken, cilantro lime rice, black beans, fajita veggies, 2 scoops corn salsa, cheese, sour cream, and a dusting of lettuce.  On the side I get a bag of chips with guac so that I can either eat the burrito bowl "nacho style" or just straight up with the guac.  AND NOW I WANT EXACTLY THAT!!!
124149619252_10152236327209253:Tofu is not a "meat substitute." It is nothing like meat. It is just another vegetarian protein, much like beans.
124149619252_134085872963:Completely agree w/Kimberely. I can't believe any of you are over the age of...I don't know...12. Really sad.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito or burrito bowl, your choice, extra white rice, black beans, barbacoa and carnitas half and half, corn salsa, medium salsa, JUST a pinch of sour cream and cheese.
124149619252_10151053134024253:I wish I could say it was while living in Barcelona...but you guys aren't here...so hard getting by...
124149619252_10153096213679253:Kathleen Doyle you and matt and Eli Doyle and Shane McLaughlin and Meg Hill should enter the contest! Sophia Pacheco do this and have mom and Hannah do it too! Just text IZZE4 to 888222
124149619252_10151973813714253:Yeah and it wasn't getting a burrito! That line was wrapped around the whole restaurant! People go nuts for $3 burittos!
124149619252_10153720921419253:I literally came here to see if the customer service troll was still here! They say even bad advertising is GOOD advertising, I just read about it on another page and now I wanna go get Chipotle tomorrow LOL! :)
124149619252_10152724330769253:I feel sad cause they let me go today at work chipotle they said i was just to quiet for the team they said i'm a very good worker is that I don't talk to lot and they think i'm not a team player which I am is that  if you keep goofing around and keep talking and not action your store is not gonna get that restantour for sure and are  Kitchen managers are just lazy to help out new workers and show attitude to workers that why we don't wanna ask help and try to do it are self and they come  back to us  saying that we not asking them for help so they think were  not team players that's why also don't know that my hands hurt badly from cooking in the grill and washing dishing cold and hot water cause Arthritis and cramps so every morning my hand would hurt bad but still show up to work after that in end of my shift I need to do only 2 full pans of fajitas I do 4 pans and only 5 pan of cartina i do 6 pans everyday and only 1 cliantro one day I did all my stuff and the KM told me to do 3 pan of cilantro since my hand was hurt badly that day I was able to do only one pan and it past my time to work time so i told my GM can I leave after i'm done with my one pan he said yes so the next morning the KM just told me were letting you go cause it feels like you don't care about chipotle and only made one pan of cilantro I was like dam  feeling taking advantage  of heart breaking it a good place to work
124149619252_10150942028479253:I always tell the waiter that I want to cry like my dog just died. I usually get to experience the disappointment but not the tears.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Vegetarian burrito!!! No pepper and onions - with black beans, salsa, corn salsa, sour cream cheese and lots of lettuce. YUM!
124149619252_10151653181349253:Did your favorite Mexican places serve healthy, sustainable food and actually care about the environment like chipotle? You can go to the ghetto to get MSG Chinese any day, I'll support these guys, glad you won't be in line in front of me!
124149619252_10152883478794253:I love all these rednecks posting outrage here who have probably never eaten at Chipotle in their life.
124149619252_10153806089609253:Just read a great piece about Chipotle being set up by groups like Monsanto. I believe in what you guys are doing and see your commitment to keeping your customers healthy and happy!
124149619252_10151486609219253:Chicken, pinto beans, white cilantro lime rice, pico, hot salsa, and shredded Monterrey cheese!!! SOO GOOOOD!
124149619252_10152925087634253:You and your Brooklyn store have the support of all my friends and family.  Do the right thing and don't punish the employees.
124149619252_212886842115332:want to ask. pardon me I am from Indonesia, how to build a business in my country? because I wanted to build this business in my town, thank you
124149619252_10153246130479253:You do realize that nearly everything we consume has been genetically modified in some way and that this isn't an accurate statement?
124149619252_10152996855759253:Would if I could get down the hill from work!  4foot drifts in places, I think it's home I go when I'm thru here!
124149619252_10151556916969253:If I am to stay here in Michigan, there needs to be another location here in the Greater Grand Rapids area.  I think there should be one near Walker, MI or near Rockford, MI.  Driving 21 miles to a Chipotle restaurant may not always be feasible.
124149619252_10151316869709253:Awesome! Glad you guys aren't making my holiday ban list like McDonald's, Walmart, and so many others have. :D
124149619252_10151089035244253:I like all Chipotle locations.  So far they have better food than any sit down restaurants I have tried in my new area.
124149619252_10153602183249253:It's probably a mental thing...They did it knowing people would take the time to research or call and it's what they do to get their jollies off
124149619252_10151243108649253:When will be opening your store in Wilmington,NC.And exactly where in Wilington ,NC.And What date will you opening up.
124149619252_199537401806:EVANSVILLE, INDIANA DESPERATELY NEEDS YOUR ATTENTION .. IF I HAVE TO EAT ONE MORE JV BURRITO PRODUCT I am going to have to move....
124149619252_10153071208839253:Love you, Chipotle.  Do not bring back carnitas until suppliers follow humane standards.  Thanks for doing what is right!
124149619252_10152250518069253:a couple of years back there WAS a free lunch at the Phoenix Valley Chipotles.  So it HAS happened but is just a shame that this was "too good to be true."  Sad it was not handled a little more professionally, though.
124149619252_10152406485254253:Well they have right to ban fire arms, I have the right to spend my money else where. The choices we make.
124149619252_130916887010628:We're stationed in germany and i would kill for a chipolte burrito and 2 dollars is a damn good deal! and it's all for a good cause! stop being selfish when chipolte restaurants are trying to be selfless. 
124149619252_10152354297542741:I've been avoiding watching this because it's probably gonna make me want a burrito which I can't afford right now.
124149619252_10153246130479253:YES!!!! Its time to get back to our roots! Show every restaurant the way home to real food and health!
124149619252_10153246130479253:I applaud Chipotle, and I like their food. We still have freedom of choice and I think we should exercise it thoughtfully and decisively!
124149619252_454413931302356:No bullying here Lowell Nelson. All we did was withdraw a minor sponsorship. I think the scouts will be just fine. - Joe
124149619252_199537401806:Thank you for being in Ohio. I'm sure we singlehandedly could keep the franchise afloat lol it's REALLY big here
124149619252_10153806089609253:I had a delicious lunch at Chipotle Mexican Grill yesterday - and got my dinner to go..... BETTER THEN EVER! Enjoyed every bite <3
124149619252_10152935096524253:that looks like a Vegan burrito. Assuming it has no cheese and protein is sofritas. Lots of Guac too. Yum!
124149619252_10152354297542741:Used to eat at Baja Fresh and then my husband introduced me to Chipotle thirteen years ago. Loved it! Still my favorite place to eat.
124149619252_105860719543628:So exciting! This is an amazing video and it really shows what Chipotle is trying to do to change how we think about our food.
124149619252_135356053201187:Good show....for the judges! I think the show itself is just ok, we shall see how many episodes it will take before it becomes a snooze fest.
124149619252_10152357093419253:guys be careful , I just heard chipotle will be raising their prices by almost 6% .look like another big corporation trying to make bigger profits ..i know i am definitely not going to be going here anymore .
124149619252_10152489832309253:Arshan, I'm sorry to hear about your visit. Will you please tell us more here: http://chip.tl/re0OLp so we can properly address this? -Skyllo
124149619252_10151024826814253:Great question.  Veggie bowl: Black beans, chopped tomatoes, guac and lettuce. I love more than one scoop and request it as this light meal is not filling to eat lettuce and tomatoes and is still fast food and healthy.  Vegans are cheap to feed saving on meats, cheese, sour cream, etc.  Sorry to shock some staff at times.  Love veggie bowl.
124149619252_10151687038594253:I have tried every way possible to put in the correct answer to todays puzzle but it wont accept it. Is is really that case sensitive?  Also keep getting kicked out to the log in screen in the process........ Urrrrg!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito with white rice, pinto beans, half steak, half chicken, mild salsa, sour cream, and cheese. (Guacomole if I'm feelin it)
124149619252_10151486609219253:White rice, black beans, half steak/chicken, hot salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.  TOPPED OFF WITH CHIPOTLE TABASCO <3
124149619252_10151251776579253:Like as in I'd Like a fancy shmancy Chipotle Hoodie http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-01-29/chipotle-adds-organic-hoodies-to-burritos-to-boost-sales
124149619252_10151089035244253:After being in Uganda for two weeks, and Paris for one, it really doesn't matter, we just desperately need some Chipolte. We will probably be at Lake Forest, CA on wednesday night!
124149619252_10151520750889253:Thank you for closing for Easter so that the employees can spend time with their families!  We LOVE Chipotle and this makes us like you more!!
124149619252_10152453918534253:Who do I contact abt getting one in Plattsburgh, NY? I really appreciate that you listened when we asked that you eliminate GMOs! There isn't a single chain place I would eat in Plattsburgh as none serve actual food & very few independent ones either! Would also love to see your Asian one there!!! Very close to Montreal so many Canadians visit the city often to shop. You'd do extremely well there. I normally don't encourage chain restaurants or stores but you are the exception to the rule!!! Thank you for serving actual food!!!
124149619252_10151086390274253:You guys need to open up shop here in France! Lots of rugby players would love a carnitas burrito with extra meat! Mmmmmmmm good recovery food
124149619252_10151058843154253:The last couple times I've went to Chipotle here in Lancaster, Ohio, they have been out of chips...and the rice was hard....used to love them...
124149619252_10151024826814253:flour tacos, white rice, black beans, 2 barbacoa, 1 chicken, extra corn salsa, sour cream, lettuce, cheese.. chips & guac... dos equis lager... every time
124149619252_156053474470:so now we dont even have to get off the couch to eat something the size of our head ! hell yeah! can we have this in cinci/
124149619252_10153009001449253:Marianna Cerullo Di BellaCarla PastorRodolfo MorenoCristina MorenoCarol MorenoMichael MichelangeliJuancarlo Rodriguez???? #lifesburritoful
124149619252_10152406485254253:You mean I can now get a burrito AND rob them without having to worry about somebody drawing on me. Walter Nelson game time. I'm hungry and broke sounds like a win win to me
124149619252_10151024826814253:I do like the addition of the Brown Rice option, but I swear everytime I get chicken it tastes undercooked & raw & I simply do not choose Chipotle very often anymore
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl- white rice, black beans, steak, corn salsa and green chile salsa, sour cream and cheese. Covered in tobasco, side of chips and Guac! Bam!! Best meal ever.
124149619252_454413931302356:Chipotle says it like it is.  They are aligning their overall anti-discrimination policies as they do with worker and customer non-discrimination.  You can't do one thing with one hand, and another thing with your other hand signaling secretly behind your back; at least you should not.  Chipotle is behaving in a responsible, honest and consistent manner.  Again, good for this business taking a stand against injustice and bigotry that is prevalent in private organizations like The Boy Scouts.
124149619252_10151058843154253:Common misconception. They were heavily invested in by McDonalds during their expansion, but cut ties with them entirely a few years ago. As of now, McDonalds no longer owns stock in Chipotle.
124149619252_10152538683134253:Yeah Matt Kohlbek I like my Guac chunky, but that's a bit crazy, even for me :-P (I add tomatoes to mine when I make it at home)
124149619252_10152408378957741:Chipotle is one of my favorites! I really love the new Sofritas option as well! Keep up the great work!
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken bowl with white rice, vegetables, black beans, pico, corn, sour cream, guac, cheese, and lettuce!!:)
124149619252_182078509223:u have effectively made me want to go to to chipotle at 8:40 in the morning, possibly not a good decision...but tasty at that
124149619252_10152406485254253:It's your choice to put up that sign but as for me and my family we will not be spending our hard earned money there. 
124149619252_122372141178171:@ Jimmy, I didn't always feel this way, but I disagree with you.  You are right that a little junk isn't going to kill you, but I have ethical issues with the way fast food joints, produce, market and sell their food.  If you don't care about health, you shouldn't be serving food.  If you do care about health, you shouldn't be serving maximally processed, minimally quality food to mostly low income folks who subsist on it.  I wouldn't and don't give such an organization a dime of my hard earned money.
124149619252_194274827087:Bring the Burrito to Bozeman, MT! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE - on my knees begging - I need Chipolte!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

124149619252_10151024826814253:love that everything is fresh... the guacamole, sour cream, salsas... they make the difference.... oh and the excellent meats
124149619252_10153246130479253:Genetically altered food is safe. It's been proven safe over and over and over. Why are you doing this?
124149619252_10152560126959253:Double wrapped double barbacoa burrito, white rice, no beans, double hot red salsa, cheese and lettuce. Chips and guacamole. Sweet tea. Heaven.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie Bowl: White rice, black beans, lots of green sauce, no cheese or sour cream, but lots of guac with just enough lettuce to cover the guac in my to-go bowl.  #Vegan delight!
124149619252_10153066985824253:Jesse Graham. I know it's not exactly local to where you work, but at least they've broken into the state!
124149619252_10153246130479253:could care less if there are GMO's in my burrito. if they make the food taste better i'm all for it (y)
124149619252_10152407734029253:It's upsetting to see Latino (or other) writers excluded from their campaign. However, if a Latino goes to Chipotle to eat "Latino food" then I have to say they're Hispanic, not Latino. Anyone who believes this restaurant's food remotely resembles or tastes like Latinoamerican food (namely Mexican) has NEVER tasted REAL Latino flavors. It's like suggesting Taco Bell sells Mexican food.  People, there's a HUGE difference between being Latino and being Hispanic. Hispanics don't know (because they've never been to or forgotten about) South America. A Latino will NEVER forget their roots, no matter how much time passes.  Jaime M Cornejo
124149619252_10152881168629253:Today menu salad bowl brown rice black beans mixed veggies, half chicken half carnitas, sour cream, corn and mild salsa ...
124149619252_454413931302356:Right on Donna Willis Hyland, you're welcome to your beliefs, and we're totally cool with that. We're not not intending to tell anybody what to do. We're just electing to support organizations that are like-minded with us. - Joe
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito, brown rice, black beans, green salsa, lots of sour cream and cheese. And ALWAYS with chips and guac to share!
124149619252_10153736393409253:Not eating at Chipotle anymore; I do not want to get sick. The one in Lakeland fl, is not very clean anyway, and associates do not change their gloves after handling money or sweeping. Restaurant always looks dirty when I go.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl, veggies, barbacoa, guac, fresh salsa and lettuce.  Guac is so good I wish I could take a bath in it!
124149619252_156053474470:There were so many times when I was at work, and didn't have time to eat, that I would have loved to have the option of having Chipotle delivered ! Even now as an at home mom; it gets so hectic around the house I would LOVE to get a class A meal from my favorite place. :-)
124149619252_10153236016399253:How far do you think they're willing to deliver haha? It'll save us the trip of driving downtown just for a burrito :P Mark Shiwram
124149619252_10152236327209253:Not vegan  but I don't eat a lot of meat.  Chiken bowl has been my Fav forever. Barbacoa has become my new Fav in the last year. Would like to try this in #KansasCity
124149619252_10153009001449253:Any chance you'll repeat this offer on the east coast?  The weather is predicting that we'll all be buried in with snow tomorrow :(
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito w/ white rice, steak & barbacoa, black & pinto beans, hot & mild salsa, cheese, and once in a while lettuce complicated: yes delicious: also yes
124149619252_10153009001449253:Whilst Target pulls out of our dearest friends in Canada, Chipoltle thrives because it just makes sense!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Almost a week after this post, and I'm still seeing people sharing it on their timeline today like it's real. Gullible beyond belief. Do people ever check stuff out before they post it? Snopes or check with the source before posting maybe.
124149619252_205455487672:For the guy who was asking about mcdonalds, yes mcdolands used to own chipotle, but about a year or two ago the original owners bought it back from mcdonalds.
124149619252_10153009001449253:All out of sofritas! So disappointed. Poor planning/management. As much as this has been promoted, there should have been enough.
124149619252_205455487672:my fiance lives in England, and when he comes to visit in December I'm going to take him for his first Chipotle experience! I'm glad when I move to England I can still get Chipotle when I visit London ^-^  you should put a Chiptole in Birmingham too!
124149619252_10153656854824253:My local store always rips me off on the guacamole! Tells me I can't have extra also won't let me have 3 meats ! Wth man
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito with white rice and black beans! Mild salsa, medium salsa on the side, with sour cream and cheese...and guac, of course! :)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito half the rice, mixed beans, steak +x-tra chix, cheese, sour cream, hot salsa, guac.......and a large Ice tea... sit down and douse with chipotle Tabasco FTW
124149619252_10152949800154253:Susie Thurmond one bad Apple does not constitute a rotten orchard. Don't blame chipotle. Blame the individual
124149619252_10152261058584253:Hey..how about a loyalty program..maybe punch card for 10th burrito free or something for us loyal customers in AZ and everywhere else..
124149619252_10153246130479253:GMOs are NOT bad for you!!! Come on people we make fun of the climate change deniers but are we really going to embrace this? If so, then we are no better.
124149619252_10151809543439253:I don't care about any if that, I want breakfast burritos in my chipotle. I've been saying it for years mad then come to find out that some chipots already do.. Grrrr
124149619252_10153246130479253:Now if you can just get some consistency in the portion sizes. "Grabs" of barbacoa are so inconsistent, sometimes one is plenty, sometimes I have to pay for a double to get what I think is right - and usually end up with too much as a result.
124149619252_10153001213604253:Some of you need to read their website. They are having a shortage of pork. They didn't take it off the menu.
124149619252_10151719407409253:Joe Why isn't the submit button working it was a pain in the butt to put all that in and not be able to submit it
124149619252_10153009001449253:I love tofu, but the sofritas is not my fav. Can't please them all, but I still love me some Chipotle!
124149619252_10153736393409253:You were the only fast food restaurant I would go to thanks to you use of humanely-treated animals and other local ingredients. When the EColi outbreak happened I wondered, 'how could this be? your ingredients are sourced locally. later, in discussing the EColi issue you stated you do not source locally in a meaningful way, thus explaining how the EColi, typical of contamination in industrial farm supply chains, can be present in so many of your stores around the US. So now you supported the Young Farmers Conference??? Let's see you walk the walk with your own supply chain: Use those young farmers as significant suppliers. Use other suppliers who offer local ingredients and who can stand behind their products. Build a new supply chain. The lip service doesn't work any longer.
124149619252_279121798773401:The article is right, people want fresher food.  We just got a Chipolte in the QCA, and are sooo excited!  (we loved you so much, we would go into Chicago for it).  LOOOVVEEE your food!  In fact, I don't think our kids even know what McDonalds is...  :)
124149619252_10153656854824253:But imagine doing that 4 more times in an hour.  But this is exactly how it's like to work there. You got to eat everything you made, and even the spoons had to go in the top left hand corner of the pan...I don't miss it at all!
124149619252_10152250518069253:It's not so dumb...I've gotten a free meal on nights they have had "theme" nights near colleges so all those calling ppl stupid...jokes on you because it has happened, just this one is not valid.
124149619252_10153013362654253:If there isn't always a long line I will go! I love Chiptole, but the lines in Miami Kendall are way too long for busy people. I tried ordering online too, but the pickup time is like 45 minutes later!
124149619252_10151058843154253:As a previous employee of Chipotle, and a current employee of a large solar energy company, this makes me proud!
124149619252_10151024826814253:the veggie bowl..not much hope for vegetarians other than that..anyhow, v r still heading down there for a veggie bowl dinner tonite..i hope they don't run out of corn..(the palo alto one runs out of corn by 9 or 9:15pm) :(
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa, black beans, extra tomatoes, lettuce and guacamole. I'm hungry just writing this and it's only 6:20 a.m.!!!

124149619252_10153246130479253:Way to appeal to the lowest level of scientific literacy. Good marketing though, it works for scam artists, why not for otherwise good food?
124149619252_10153878506969253:We all know you're a company with value. Never mind the sabotage.. the majority of us know it..   and we still stand behind you.! keep going  GMO-Free.

124149619252_10153246130479253:Congratulations, this is fantastic news. I've always supported Chipotle as I've seen the efforts in the right direction, but to finally rid yourselves of Monsanto's garbage is amazing. Continue this and you'll keep me and my family as a customer for life!
124149619252_10152595862934253:you shouldn't post things after 10 chipotle. Itts not fair makes me want some but I have to wait till tomorrow now
124149619252_10152250518069253:It's a sad day friends..John Howley, Mark Heneghan, and whomever reposted the free burrito pic like I did. I feel so used.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Bol, brown rice, tomatillo salsa, corn salsa, cheese, sour cream and LOTS of lettuce..then I use a chip as an edible fork :))) 
124149619252_10153602183249253:Like how obvious was it that it was photoshopped! Kyle Weiss you should just delete that you shared that pic it only hurts a good American company that was done wrong by some jackass with photoshop
124149619252_194274827087:It's no Mighty Taco (Buffalo hometown chain), although I'm sure Chipotle will hold it's own. It will be nice to have options when I visit too. 
124149619252_10153736393409253:I loved this place but I'll definitely be staying away now.  http://www.boston.com/news/local/2015/12/08/boston-college-students-ill-after-eating-chipotle/r9qvqlMLjVdV9CxRsnpaFN/story.html?p1=feature_pri_ho

124149619252_10152883478794253:Someone who lives in the area where this happened should share this story with a local news station. They can confront  the owners and company executives for answers.
124149619252_10150719072154253:Happy a location opened just 30minutes from where I live. Haven't been able to get in yet. Long lines and short lunches don't mix.
124149619252_135356053201187:@Megan. That's not his fault. That's the fault of a bad decision in an isolated incident at one restaurant.
124149619252_221129944611968:I still patiently waiting for one to come to the Huntsville/Madison, AL  cities.  If you'd like you can put one in Huntsville near Bridgestreet Mall and one on Hiway 72  next to the new Target or on County Line Rd. in Madison.
124149619252_10152108930454253:That's really nice you give everyone a day off. I am bummed tho cuz I'm craving a burrito. I will have to get one for lunch tomorrow.  Happy new year!
124149619252_455264284485429:Tarah Locke It's true that we have not ever claimed to be free of imperfection in many things that we do, and we will never be able to make that claim. So, you may find fault with us for other things besides soybean oil undoubtedly as well, but we would like to at least note that we are on a journey to improve our restaurants and our food supplies and practices.   And we would like to make a minor clarification to your assertion: Under our nation's current food labeling systems, a food that is not entirely organic is not guaranteed to be genetically modified (as many foods are not organic but could potentially also be GMO free), only vice versa. That said we are certainly aware of the issues pertaining to soybean oil, which is why we are at this very moment testing GMO-free sunflower and rice bran oils that are not necessarily organic but are indeed GMO-free. And hopefully we'll be able to implement something like this in our restaurants on a wider scale in the future. - Joe
124149619252_10152250518069253:It's sad that people are getting upset that Chipotle won't honor this fake coupon. If you were a business owner and someone circulated a fake coupon for free merchandise at your store, would you accept it?
124149619252_10151486609219253:brown rice, pinto beans, whatever meat I crave that day, medium salsa, extra sour cream, and lettuce.
124149619252_10153528761379253:Be careful at the Chipotle in west hartford ct .. I found a ???????? in my food ... I loved this place until today
124149619252_10153489422339253:...except when someone calls or faxes in a huge order and you were physically in the restaurant, next in line to be served.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito bowl with rice, pinto beans, mild salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.  Also, splitting an order of chips to scoop or put a drop of chipotle pepper sauce on chips.
124149619252_10152250518069253:I don't want free lunch. But I want what I paid for. The quantity is so less !! As compared to Qdoba..and even when compared to other locations, this chipotle serves meager quantities at galleria mall
124149619252_10151520750889253:Danny... The Easter Bunny is not going to bring you anything. He does not like you!  Sent from my Galaxy S®III
124149619252_10153486712199253:The Dark Act is passing through the Senate. This will remove all ingredient lists from our food. DARK - Denying Americans the Right to Know. We must stop this! Call your Senators!!  GMO FREE USA
124149619252_10153903490999253:So did you hear about Dole's lettuce E. coli?  I Will support and eat at Chipotle forever.  At least weekly ;). Never an issue for me nor anyone i know!  Love Chipotle, especially for what they stand for!!  No GMOs forever!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Alvin Chege Marisa Rose Andrade Timothy Irvin Jr. Valerie Speir  Suzette Evringham Jasmine Oregel Frances Sorrentino
124149619252_10153135670549253:Sadly just not as good without carnitas anymore. I went there every other day. But the other options are always dry with little flavor. I want carnitas back! Asap!
124149619252_10152250518069253:This was heartbreaking I cant believe my favorite place for lunch wont own up and create a discount for this mishap.  I walked in to my local store and felt so embarrassed.  Truely insulting
124149619252_10152715839394253:Flour tacos! White rice, pinto beans, steak, corn, dash of sourcream and cheese! Yummmmmm. Good think I work here (:
124149619252_10153009001449253:I am taking a break from Chipotle until the pork carnitas are back. I understand and support the supply issue.
124149619252_10152018242589253:I can't WAIT for my trip home to Ohio!! I miss Chipotle SO much!! Impatiently waiting for one in Rapid City or Spearfish, SD lol
124149619252_10151839071994253:please please open one in the inner city of cleveland around St.clair. Chipotle is quick & healthy; it's the only fast-food that I buy regularly. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!
124149619252_10151486609219253:White rice, black beans, tomato, corn, and hot salsas. Sour cream, cheese, guacamole and lettuce. Yum, now I must have this for dinner!
124149619252_10151486609219253:So sorry to remove you from my list of eateries but your actions are not deserving of my support.  The BSA is a private organization, just as a gay club is a private organization.  They have the right to make their own rules...if you don't like the rules then don't join or start your own tolerance DOES NOT mean forcing others to do your will!  The BSA has been around for a century instilling wholesome values and responsibility in young men.  If you cannot support them then I cannot support you!
124149619252_329592670434256:I dont believe this... imagine everyone going on a splurge to buy chipotle just to be entered to win... yeah right...-_- love chipotle though :)
124149619252_197492226983965:Looks like a great event - wish I could go.  But I was really interested in the dishes Chipotle was debuting there.  They sound great and I was wondering if they might hit the stores anytime soon?  Pozole soup, Barbacoa chili and queso fresco definitely caught my eye.
124149619252_156053474470:Hell yes!!!! Now please do it in Northeastern Ohio!!!!! and please please please Put one in Pensacola Florida!!!!!
124149619252_10153498699374253:I know Chipotle was approved for Effingham IL. I am patiently waiting for you to break ground. Please start soon. We need you!!
124149619252_10152560126959253:Sofritos burrito bowl with brown rice, black beans, fajita veg, mild and corn salsa, sour cream, and cheese. And no, I'm not a vegetarian! The sofritos are just that good!
124149619252_178542422170361:I've been talking tio some managers in tallahassee florida and they have mentioned opening up in panama city fl. I hope they come  further west to this area which is populated by Moe's. This town needs some quality food.
124149619252_10153896327714253:Come on folks let's be real! Chipotles food truly has very little flavor unless you drench it with the bottle of tobacco sauce they provide and they are way over priced.
124149619252_10151024826814253:salad, steak, brown rice, black beans, tomatoes, lots of corn...oh and dont forget dressing. Everyday
124149619252_10153693560944253:Go to any fast food type restaurant anywhere and you face the very same risks. Chipotle has always had a good reputation for a good reason! To me the fact that they will actually admit the fact they don't actually know, does say something! Instead of rolling out the P.R. Campaign, they actually come off as their priority is fixing the problem first and the 300k they are loosing a day seems secondary. For once!! They will let the public know when they know and be a better company for it!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito Bowl, steak, peppers, extra white rice, pinto beans, tomato salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce...
124149619252_10151258924194253:Very refreshing to see a company that values it's employees and allows them to spend time with family!
124149619252_10151486609219253:Steak, white rice (extra), grilled veggies, hot salsa, pico de gallo, corn, sour cream, cheese, guacamole, and the hot green sauce! Ain't nothing beat that...
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito with extra white rice no beans mild salsa sour cream cheese and lettuce mmmmmm and chips with hot salsa 
124149619252_10151895014639253:has to be rochester, ny.  we have such amazing views, mountain ranges, streams, and wonderful tourism.  wait, no, if more chipotles were in Rochester, then maybe that would enhance the area.......
124149619252_10153145422064253:Alexis: I wanna go to this with you, because it seems like something you would like. Oh, &  seeing twenty|one|pilots for free; yeah there's also that. ????????????????????????
124149619252_10153009001449253:Waited in line for a half an hour in Little Rock only to find out when we got to the counter they were out of the sofritas. They had a sign on their door saying they were out of carnitas but I guess they didn't feel the need to inform their vegan/vegetarian customers they didn''t have any options for them today. The least they could have done was seen the long line and shouted they were out of sofritas so we didn't wait in line that long for nothing. Not angry they ran out (although it does show how poorly-planned this promotion was, apparently not only in Little Rock considering the rest of the reviews here!), but angry nobody felt the need to inform us they were out of the product (most) people were obviously in line for. Additionally, how ironic that in promoting a product for vegans/vegetarians, they end up alienating that very same crowd, as "honoring the promotion with a meat option instead" wasn't an option for us. VERY disappointing.
124149619252_10152406485254253:Adios, only the local Mexican restaurant from now on. Good luck protecting yourselves from robbers only to appease the radicals.
124149619252_10153395310879253:@ all the people saying they won't eat here anymore. Do you honestly think you saying that is going to change the companies opinion? No one is forcing you to eat here, just like no one is forcing you to get married to someone of the same sex.
124149619252_10153034270734253:Paulo Coelho? Really? Should we expect excerpts from books by Rhonda Byrne, Tony Robbins and Og Mandino? Maybe even Napoleon Hill?
124149619252_10152406485254253:Thanks guys for the collective suggestion above, and we appreciate it! This project is just beginning, but we'll definitely add further variety to our already awesome selection of authors for the next round. -Joe
124149619252_10153009001449253:To be honest, I tried the Sofritas (not by my own decision) and I got really sick, vomiting just a few hours later. Couldn't have been anything else, it was all I had eaten at that day.
124149619252_256556984380282:A festival like that would be HUGE in the Biggest Little City in the World!  Reno!  Come to Reno Chipotle, you would do so well here!
124149619252_10153246130479253:According to NPR, the soft drinks they sell are still made with GMO corn (cornsyrup) and all the meat they serve were fed GMO grain. What baffles me most is why so many people care about possible effects of GMOs, when so few people care about the very real and demonstrated effects of so many other unhealthy foods that many people eat all the time.
124149619252_10152883478794253:Got the worst Steak Bowl i have ever had today, yuck and waste of money and drive, had no seasoning on it whatsover, beans were like soup, and tomatoe salsa was also soupy and zero seasoning on steak, will be awhile before i go back and waste my money and time, and i love Chilpotle.
124149619252_10151486609219253:For my first burrito, I want steak, beans, cheese and lettuce. It may not seem like much...but it would be yummy...
124149619252_10150959152619253:WHO CARES where this restaurant is!?! I'll tell you where it needs to be, on the military base in Iwakauni, Japan. I nearly died during my second pregnancy because of the lack of amazing burritos. Word.
124149619252_10150399959924253:really people?  if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.  congrats to the winners and hers to chipotle for all they do!
124149619252_10151892810414253:Uday Patel we didn't win...no free burritos for us. :( Well anways congrats to those who did win & and enjoy the amazing reward!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Brown rice, black beans, double steak, two scoops of hott, corn salsa, cheese. best one i have found so far
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl, half chicken and steak, brown rice, black beans, pico, corn salsa, salsa roja, cheese, sour cream, and as much lettuce as they can fit on top.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Hey I still might try it. I'll just have them make it then show them the add. Then be like don't throw it away might as well like me get it lol
124149619252_10153009001449253:Thank you for not being afraid to use the word "vegan" in your store promotions. I hope that more customers will ask for this option. I think you'll get even more business if you do.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Trust me, you won't get anything free from Chipotle. And with the "climate change" reason for possibly discontinuing the guacamole they can shove it, I'm done.
124149619252_205455487672:That's awesome, we'll have to check it out! Hopefully it won't be like the rest of the American restaurants in the UK - the food is terrible in every one we've been in... it's just not the same as in the States. Chipotle ROCKS! We'll definitely be giving it a try once they open... we miss Chipotle!
124149619252_10152996855759253:Thank you sincerely for your practice of only buying humanely raised animals.  Carnitas is my favorite, and I have so much respect for you taking it off the menu until vendors with higher standards can be found.  Wow, a company that puts ethics above profit!  Bravo!
124149619252_10152093036984253:If I don't eat Chipotle ten times a day I'll die... Do you guys really want that on your hands? Can you deal with the guilt?
124149619252_182078509223:That sounds great!! When are we going to get a Chipotle in Kenosha WI??? I absoutely LOVE your food!!!

124149619252_182076481805338:Just because a chipotle employee hit at cat does not mean it is a reflection of chipotle... move on people its getting old...   I love chipotle I had a steak burrito on Thursday with the chips and it was all yummy!
124149619252_10153872104594253:My family and I LOVE Chipotle - we never once left or doubted how great your product is! Keep up the great work!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie or chicken bowl. White rice,  sometimes brown rice, black beans,   Peppers onions, salsa, spicy sauce,   Sour cream, corns, and lettuce. I add the mole if I am super hungry lol... Man I am so wanting Chipotle now :p 
124149619252_10152883478794253:"Liked" b/c all the knuckleheads  are freaking out. Again. Jesus, don't you people have anything better to do? Channel all that OUTRAGE!!! elsewhere. This place just makes burritos.
124149619252_10151089035244253:there isin't one anymore, all of your restaurants have failed me with uncooked meat and crappy service
124149619252_10151293547634253:I think chipotle girls should wear some cute shirts, makes them feel more girlie, it wil improve their selfsteam to the max, they wil b more outgoin, feelin beautiful! Of course with the chipotle logo! Just my thought :)
124149619252_10153150981964253:Dang man... seeing it in action like this makes it impossible NOT to get one yo Jordan AaronHuntBrandon Hunt ????????????????????????????????????????
124149619252_10152935096524253:We have tried the new Augusta, Maine restaurant twice.  The first time you were out of tortillas.  This time, a Monday night by the way, you were out of cheese and sour cream.  I understand things happen but it would be nice if you offered some sort of discount for our inconvenience...
124149619252_10151192106409253:Maybe you should ask your stores to adhere to their advertised times on Halloween. Was turned away, because a store changed their hours on a whim.
124149619252_10152883480984253:Now tell me why people of Chinese ancestry are being denied pork carnitas?  Pork is part of my people's history.  Don't bow down to false prophets!  Adios, Chipotle.
124149619252_10151089035244253:Elizabeth loves Chipotle! Please Chipotle open one up in Elizabeth, NJ! tourist that come Elizabeth from around the world would love that! <3
124149619252_261338423981855:(Keri) What I don't get is why more chain restaurants don't follow Chipotle's business model? After all, they're insanely successful.
124149619252_10153514914799253:Chipotle, why do you like your restaurants in places where parking is limited??!! There's been so many times I had to eat somewhere because of this.
124149619252_10152408378957741:Richard, take the Eurostar to London. A few locations there. :-). Not a cheap trip, but it IS closer to home, and is cheaper than flying over the pond...
124149619252_10152786808474253:I love eating Chipotle's burritos. I lived off the $6 burrito during college years and was so delicious. Now that i'm in China, I don't have the privilege of dropping by. I can't wait til next visit home. That's always my first stop off the flight.
124149619252_10152250518069253:To me, that would be one good sales gimmick for people who never had Chipolte to be able to try it and of they like it, they will continue to be regular customers.
124149619252_363324750372027:I am going to go make a sandwich, when i come back to my computer this had better be the top liked comment.
124149619252_100780796665922:Here's how it goes: Qdoba - Has queso, open very late Chipotle - Meat tastes better (insert sexual innuendo)  Since I have no Qdoba around here, Chipotle is just fine.
124149619252_10153395310879253:Those who are saying no more chipotle because of this should live one day as a normal person, and then shut the hell up. #leaveamericaifyoudontlikeit
124149619252_10150163731434253:I love you guys, but what a waste of foil! It's all going to end up being thrown away. Just what we need, more garbage. I'm disappointed in you, Chipotle. Very disappointed.
124149619252_10152883486474253:My chipotle name is "Beefdrew Guacencheddar III"  hhahah............i'll stick to my original name. "Big Cheese Dadday"
124149619252_10152599784994253:Mmmmm, I bet it smells awesome there!  I tried to grow cilantro in my garden, it was great till I accidentally let it over grow and it flowered! Oops!
124149619252_454413931302356:Very true, Rob Niccolai--proof that religious conservatives are not into free speech--unless of course, they are the ones speaking.
124149619252_10153734396969253:What was scary was spending ALL DAY IN THE BATHROOM!!!!!  Thanks a lot guys... and further your customer service department is doing a terrible job of reaching me!
124149619252_10151307314369253:All this tlk of closings is understandable around the holidays but what about opening a restraunt In Duluth MN
124149619252_10152307671269253:For those who don't know. Chipotle Corp decided to buy beef from Australia because of low quality beef from Texas not up to quality standards  watch the  YouTube video news
124149619252_10153009001449253:You know, I would SO do this, if only we actually had a Chipotle Mexican Grill near us.  I think the closest one to us is 2 hours way, up in/near Atlanta.  I miss having Chipotle burritos.
124149619252_10152571682409253:Are both Steve and Monty coming? I work at the Chipotle right next to PDX, so I assume they'll be stopping by to check things out! Haha
124149619252_10153351140389253:Hey Chipotle so glad you have gone no GMOs. How about getting rid of that evil poisonous pink sweetener you provide for iced tea?  Lot of healthier choices out there!
124149619252_10153066985824253:Andrea Ornelas, I did not. At 39 I am now finally wise enough to use discretion in the choices I make in life. Only took my about 35 years to figure that out.
124149619252_10153130476489253:Just because you're not sourcing from CAFOs does NOT mean you're serving up SAFE meat. Unless that meat is GRASS FED or ORGANIC fed you are serving up GMO meat from animals raised on a diet of GMO grains and/or GMO alfalfa.
124149619252_10152082036279253:Very bad news!!!! I thought Chipotle is naturaly raised and organic food.... I will never go there agin.
124149619252_10153009001449253:I've never stepped foot in a chipotle. Guess I gotsta meow! #freeismyfavoritenumber  Octavio Dexter Espinosa
124149619252_10151089035244253:Any of the East Coast ones because they look historic being in brick buildings, or actually are historic like the one in Boston that is a stop on the Freedom Trail! Why can't West Coast Chipotles look as cool?
124149619252_10151316869709253:Love Chipotle Mexican Grill, me and my girl went to the Portland, ME  location on Chistmas eve. They closed @ 4pm, I arrived at 4:04pm doors locked employees including the manager saw me and waved. I live 4hrs away so I trip to chipoltes is or was a treat. GREAT HOLIDAY ATTITUDE  Sincerely former customer
124149619252_10152250518069253:Actually that is a lie as for numerous years since chipotle first came to my down we got a free burrito Halloween for dressing up Sooo....there is such a thing as a free burrito
124149619252_10151024826814253:Had a barbacoa burrito with brown rice, black beans, tomato and hot, a little sour cream and cheese for lunch with chips and green salsa!!! Perfect!!!
124149619252_209217239092800:I used to work at a Chipotle. They will FAIL! Lol, you can't walk in and do what they do. Thats what makes Chipotle AWESOME!
124149619252_10151486609219253:Brown rice, fajitas, pinto, steak (double please), extra hot sauce, corn, a bit of lettuce, sour cream and extra cheese. #nomnom
124149619252_10151316869709253:Kudos for valuing family time over the holidays! Happy New Year- we can wait one more day for our first burritos of 2013!
124149619252_147322035888:Actually, that was pretty fucking dope. People shit on the this video, but really-- it appeals to a much larger group than the second place video does. I love hip hop and all, but seeing the second place video makes me feel like they're kinda forcing it on a younger demographic rather than just making a nice commercial.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie bowl with a little brown cilantro rice, black beans, fajita veggies, tomato salsa, lettuce, and cheese!
124149619252_10151024826814253:steak burrito, extra rice, black beans, 2 scoops of corn, sourcream cheese and lettuce. 1 tortilla is never enough.
124149619252_454413931302356:I see I need to increase my visits to Chipotle. Just to piss off all the Fundies shaking their bigoted heads.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito Bowl (not the burrito in the bowl) Steak, black beans, hot sauce, sour cream && cheese. Simple and yet delicious!!! && if I'm really hungy, I get half steak && half chicken! :))
124149619252_10153246130479253:Hey Tyler Otis before you speak of tin hats, GET INFORMED!glyphosate is a herbacide component..dolt.
124149619252_10153896327714253:Just had Chipotle last weekend for the first time ever.  The chicken burrito was fantastic! Thanks for making good food
124149619252_10153246130479253:The biotech industry wants people to think that without GMO's the world would starve, it's yet another lie. Enough food was produced last year to feed 17 billion people and there are 7 billion on earth, your garbage disposal eats better than 2 billion people each day. The problem is not production it's distribution, or lack there of, because there is no money in feeding the poor and dissolute there will always be people dying from starvation like the poor soul that just died as you read this.
124149619252_10152323527922741:As a dairy farmer i'd like to let you know there are 0.000 antibiotics in your milk, also gmo's do not effect cows  therefore not effecting humans who break down proteins differently than worms. Also this is kinda poking fun at the use of bst's (cow steroids) which I do not believe in but check your milk label and it'll clearly show if they were used
124149619252_10153246130479253:I love you guys for this! I will chose you over others if at all possible! Keep up the good work of leading the market in the right direction!!! Thanks very much!!!!
124149619252_10153232136249253:Good job sticking to your ethics, Chipotle! If more companies operated with the mindset of morals over money the world would be a better place.
124149619252_10153792851004253:We were going a few times a week ... but we're afraid of the food poisoning scare. We LOVE Chipotle, but I've had food poisoning twice in my life (not Chipotle) which required me to go to the hospital, so I won't risk it again. PLEASE let us know when it's safe!!!
124149619252_10152883478794253:Ahem, peasants. You may now call me by my proper title, "General Spicezilla Adobo". Those who object shall be prosecuted immediately.
124149619252_10152343053104253:Ugh, I love Chipotle so much, I'd advertise you guys for just a life time supply of Chipotle FOR LIFE! ^_^
124149619252_10153489055424253:Guilty of #12 &#19. Living in El Paso, TX now don't ever have to worry about #18, they make the burritos tiny here compared to CO.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burritos with black beans, pico,double cheese, double sour cream, guacamole, doctor pepper with a lemon in it. sweet goodness to my mouth !
124149619252_10153009001449253:I've sampled it and hated it. I would go get it and bring it to a homeless person, but they would probably throw it at me ????
124149619252_266206333465511:Those of you who have noted you aren't getting the badge - you need to follow us on Foursquare before the check-ins count. Also, only one check-in counts per day. - Joe
124149619252_100780796665922:This isn't even a challenge. There was a Qdoba and a Chipotle basically across the street from each other in Kansas City a few years back. Qdoba shut down. Worst excuse for food I've ever had in my life, and I've eaten at Olive Garden.
124149619252_10152406485254253:Thanks for your quick positive response. I had no idea there were so many people against your stand till I read some responses here. Kind of scary.
124149619252_244699472217532:My hubby surprised me with Chipotle for lunch yesterday :-) He complained I wasn't that excited when he proposed. (I was, he just doesn't remember)
124149619252_10152883472094253:How you pay your employees says a lot about your company as well. They are the blood to your business. They walk out, your company dies. Bump them to $15 FFS
124149619252_10152406485254253:......I always preferred Sharky's Woodfired Mexican Grill over Chipotle Mexican Grill but now i have a solid reason not to step foot in there. This is a private business and you have every right not to let fire arms but i also have every right not to give you my business.
124149619252_10151587164929253:Really my chip bag didn't look like that, I took a picture of it that I'd love to share with you! 1.25 for 10 chips, that's ridiculous really?!?
124149619252_10153903490999253:I was really hoping that Chipotle would be better after the health scare but no change food is bland no taste no more for mr thanks but no thanks
124149619252_10152250518069253:not for nothing but at least offer a free food for a person's birthday.  Moe's mexican grill & firehous sub do.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie Burrito: Black beans, rice, fajitas, mild and hot salsa, cheese, sour cream, guac, lettuce....and of course the Chipotle Tabasco sauce with EVERY bite!
124149619252_10152805746454253:Xtra white rice since they cut everything in half. Chicken. Salsa. Xtra corn. Mmmmm cheese. Sour cream. Gauac!!!!!! And little lettuce. Mmmmm with rootbeer
124149619252_205082546217004:Food is awesome, but the one near my house has no one on the line that speaks English.  They sent out the manager to speak to me when I had a question about the kids' meals (they're not on the menu, but they do sell them at this location).  May make for an authentic Mexican inspired meal, but speaking having at least person up front for whom English is their first language would make ordering eaiser.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Ummmm Ethan Gwin I'll take you with me, we'll both buy one, you give me your receipt and I'll go back for real food! Sound good? Hahahaha
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito bowl, white rice, black beans, corn salsa, pico de gallo, medium salsa and hot salsa, sour cream, cheese, guac and lettuce! plus a bag of chips! yummmm <3
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken and Barbacoa burrito bowl with black beans, sour cream, corn salsa, lots of lettuce and guac!
124149619252_197492226983965:I'm one lucky sob I get allllll the Chipotle I want right across the parking lot from where I work in shakopee MN!!  BOMB!!!!
124149619252_10153708605069253:I was at Chipotle 4 times this week it's my second home. The people are nice the food doesn't make me feel bad about myself and I can walk out happier than when I went in, every time. There should definitely be a rewards system.
124149619252_228034027252006:Ungrateful people, should be happy you got it free for so long. Now chipotle has grown immensely and wouldn't be as beneficial to the company
124149619252_279121798773401:Saw that on tv and was so proud!  Its like seeing your kids concert on public television for the first time!
124149619252_10153389325099253:Well i would be eating it right now at this plaza in throggs neck but it still havent opened! Smh had to settle for applebees
124149619252_10152323527922741:This reminds me of the newspaper article that was in our paper today.  It seems in Germany a barn roof was blown off due to all the belching and farting that the cows were doing.  Go figure?
124149619252_10153009001449253:waited 45 minutes to find out that it was sold out @the west 48th street location by Rockefeller. Great to know it was "sold out" by 1PM and not inform people waiting on the line. But how can they be sold out BEFORE LUNCHTIME. If you guys advertised this deal since over a month ago, i would have thought every location would have been prepared to have more than enough Sofritas to not sell out THAT QUICK. It is prob false advertising anyways, all this hype and half the people were turned down.
124149619252_10153708605069253:Chipotle completely stopped using GMOs in April, and since then they've had three major E. Coli outbreaks, including one spanning six states occurring right now.  I'll just let thank sink in...
124149619252_10152406485254253:I love Chipotle, but PLEASE, no open carry policy!!  I want to enjoy my food without the fear of being gunned down or caught in the crossfire at lunch.  I'd rather eat somewhere without such a policy, and I will until it's changed.
124149619252_209217239092800:Ha this is the chico chipotle every night. We've mastered it, now they'll know what we have to deal with! 
124149619252_193042867405266:I watched this and it linked to other chipolte videos, one was by an employee.  Love Chipoltles and drive for 2 hours to get some.  She was whining about holding up the line with large orders.  I order to take home for a cooler for ourselves and other family members.  That was one of her upsets.  I don't see the difference money is money. And if there are not 10 other family members standing in line with me consider a shorter line with a bigger profit a plus.  Also she whined about  several people ordering kids meals for their kids and suggested they be fed at home.  Not good company promotion going on here. She suggested a fax or an online order.  When I am 2 hours away from home I don't always have internet, and I certainly don't have a fax with me.  Hopefully she is not conveying what Chipoltes feeling are.
124149619252_10151719407409253:They don't start giving daily prizes away until the last couple days of the contest. Read the rules and what not to find it for sure.
124149619252_10150959152619253:I wish you would add more seating to the Deptford, NJ store, it's too small. I still drive further to go to a bigger one. :(
124149619252_10151316869709253:Awesome that you guys are allowing employees to have time with their families, wish more retailers would follow your lead.
124149619252_10152707070879253:would love to see you ROCK us here in Little Rock! would be  great promo for your new Park Plaza store!! Just sayin... =D
124149619252_156053474470:just had a free meal it was great.ill be the gopher at my work.you can too just fax an orderin at work and go pick it up.i like my wheels to pick up.
124149619252_10151089035244253:the one by me has 3 tv's some couches a bed a place where you can make your own and drink beer and do drugs and listen to what ever music you want as loud as you want and there is a pool and women..... oh wait thats my house
124149619252_10150942028479253:O how i love Chipotle! u all have NO idea i don't eat aything but chipotle when I come home on leave- i seriously wait at the door at 1050 waiting for them to open...I put corn and hot sauce on mine- man i loveeeeeeeeee chipotle
124149619252_10151089035244253:Poor Savannah, GA. All we have is a Moe's Crapwestern Grill. :( Our nearest Chipotles are hours away (Atlanta and Jacksonville)! :(
124149619252_122372141178171:Chipotle uses all fresh ingredients, they are in line with jamie's views.   It's School districts and parents feeding kids sugar and preservative loaded foods because it's cheaper and more convenient when all it takes is a little education about food to solve this problem.
124149619252_10153656854824253:Please come to Oahu!!!! I miss my burrito bowls so much living on this island after living in Florida
124149619252_10152935096524253:Haven't had one in a few weeks now, I think it's time to make a run in the near future.  Also, I know there's several in Melbourne area already, but open one in Indialantic or at least somewhere beachside! It'd be EXTREMELY popular and closer to me! haha.
124149619252_164816057005566:Who says What mexicans eat tofu? I lived in an agricultural town in California for two years in a mexican community. The mexican grocery stores even have soya, a meat alternative made from soy isolate. They even have it in Mexico because it is so much cheaper than meat. Secondly, Chipotle is american-mexican food, so get over it.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito Bowl. I prefer black beans, cheese, corn salsa, tomato salsa, hot salsa, sour cream, chicken, and lettuce.
124149619252_10153806089609253:I'll never eat at your restaurant again every time I do I get sick for hours or a whole day your food is literally garbage I'm glad you got hit with that subpoena
124149619252_156053474470:Chipotle delivery?!?!  You mean I wouldn't have to get off my lazy ass, get into my car, and drive to get my burrito??? The burrito gods are surely smiling upon us today!  Huzzah!
124149619252_201068089933125:Why can't there be one in/around the bootheel of Missouri ??? Northeast Arkansas or West Tennessee ???
124149619252_10153319767964253:Shout out to all my Expo people who have read every bag and cup. Alma can be a real struggle sometimes ?
124149619252_10153224530184253:We got here at 11. Having a great time. And chillin in the VIP area. Thanks Vicki Haber for the hook up!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Three soft tacos, white rice, black beans, chicken, tomatoes, sour cream, lettuce, cheeese (; yum.. (And a free cup for wateerrrr LOL)
124149619252_10153423452749253:I will not be eating at your restaurant in my town anymore ,because you have punished the customers by raising the price of food to pay your employees A bigger wage in S.f.  Why take it out on us? You're a multi million dollar or a multibillion-dollar corporation.  There are many of us that will no longer be eating at your restaurant .  or maybe there will be people that buy the burrito at your place, and go elsewhere to get a soda for $1  as opposed to your $2 soda where I live.I understand you have to find a way to get that money back.   But I say you eat it.and let your customers know that you could raise the price of food, but instead you're going to keep the price is the same, and pay a higher wage like you're being forced to do.  Many of us would want to come to your restaurant knowing that you could've raised the prices on us, but didn't.  I don't believe in raising the minimum wage for these workers. Do they not realize that restaurants that are doing this are firing employees are giving them less hours? So they'll be making the same amount as they were ,when they were making less Per hour.  instead of hiring 17-year-old Joe who is in high school and has no work experience.   That 25-year-old that needs a job real bad is going to steal that job away from Joe because he has work experience, a vehicle, and he may even be college educated.
124149619252_10151089035244253:UHills in Denver, CO.  PLEASE put one in Kalispell, MT!  We recently moved here and miss Chipotle so bad!
124149619252_10152278716624253:It's a chipotle restaurant, who cares when it was built or what it used to be? It is now one of the greatest places in the world!
124149619252_10152343053104253:Thank you for closing on Easter, I am impressed. I am also a big fan of Chipotle, know for another reason.
124149619252_10152394598154253:It has been made a joke by the people who are using it to create fear and intimidation in other Americans.
124149619252_156053474470:please bring this to broward in south florida!!! there are 2 chipotles by me but they are each about a 25 minute drive away from me
124149619252_100780796665922:I love Chipoltes- but they do one thing I will NEVER understand- why are the VEGAN black beans- infront of the non vegan pinto beans?  When people get Pinto beans- the juice drips into the black beans- It makes it very hard for us non meat eaters to eat the black beans in good faith.
124149619252_10151251776579253:Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like....LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
124149619252_115365598544868:Jake Martin, what's going on? A government agency actually doing its job, sounds like. Every employer, big and small, needs to be held accountable for its hiring practices.
124149619252_10153246130479253:So instead of addressing the recommended daily salt intake from your ingredients,  you choose to focus on GMOs which have been shown to have no effect unlike salt.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Burger King, Mcdonalds,Carls Jr, Del Taco.....they all give coupons for buy something get something free....sometimes its just free! SO you cant say nothings free whenother places do it. Coupons for Chipotles would be nice once in awhile..but I still love them either way....
124149619252_10151024826814253:Just love Chipotle! I could eat there everyday of my life! Fav is extra white rice Barbacoa and extra tomato salsa....and now I'm hungry!
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken burrito with red tomatillo salsa, pinto, cheese, and a side of nachos to scoop up what falls out. it's a crisis
124149619252_164816057005566:no complaints from me, cannot wait for it to get into all the restaurants, it is LONG overdue!!!!!  <3 tofu!!!
124149619252_10151053134024253:always went to the one by metrocenter in phx, don't know how it is now, but back then the food was good and they always had beautiful people working and always super super friendly!
124149619252_10153844182544253:I'm waiting to return until I'm confident that you have identified and addressed the causes of your food-borne illness outbreaks. Used to go once or twice a week, but not these days. I miss Chipotle, but so many people have been sickened by eating at your restaurants.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Half chicken, half steak burrito, Double wrapped, Half brown half white rice. A bit of black beans, Medium & Mild salsa. Sourcream, corn, cheese, guac, and lettuce. And chips on the side.
124149619252_135356053201187:Please oh please put a Chipotle around Gandy and S. Dale Mabry. There are plenty of open store fronts available.
124149619252_10151089035244253:The Bollingbrook, IL was the first one I went to and is still my favorite! The ones in Chicago are all too packed and no longer personal >< but they are still tasty!
124149619252_10151024826814253:My fav is the chicken burrito, white rice, black beans, hot sauce, lettuce, cheese, sour cream. But there is NOTHING on the menu that I WONT EAT!!
124149619252_10151892810414253:Congrats to the winners! Chipotle is so generous. I thought there was only going to be 1 20-year winner.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Buritto,Black beans,no rice ,mild,lettuce.:-) oh and chips gotta have them!!!just had it couple of hours ago. YUM
124149619252_10152236327209253:It is a HOAX people....      http://socialnewsdaily.com/25455/no-chipotle-is-not-giving-out-free-burritos-based-on-shares-hoaxed/
124149619252_10151809543439253:Dang it i was just about to go to bed and now i'm hungry from looking at these gorditas.  And there's NO CHIPOTLE IN LOUISVILLE.  Bringone here!  Everyone still sweats QDoba
124149619252_10151058843154253:It's in Gurnee IL. It's totally sustainable with little to no impact on the environment and has it's own power source.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Im sorry chipotle your my favorite place to eat chicken steak and beef and pork are all good but the tofu was a big mistake for your restaurants.
124149619252_10150959152619253:I <3 Chipotle, but hubby doesn't like thr way the barbacoa and sour cream look together, so we haven't eaten there in abt a year! :(
124149619252_10153246130479253:It's impossible to do. I don't think 97% , of the country even knows what GMO is or what that means.  They just hear it's bad.  Sad story really.
124149619252_10153542268884253:Tyani Joseph and Mackenzie Ekstrand, you done messed-up!!!!! Should have gone to CSU! You could have been close to me AND Chipotle!
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito bowl, white rice, black beans, chicken, mild, hot, and corn salsa, extra cheese and sour cream, and lettuce...yum!!!!!:)
124149619252_10152560126959253:Burrito bowl, little rice, both beans. , chicken, tomatoes, corn, sour cream, chesse, and extra guacamole .
124149619252_10150256700954253:I love chipotle, really, I do. But the past 2 times I've gone, I have had bad experiences.  I think chipotle and I are going to take a break.
124149619252_10153844182544253:Stop teasing already and give us free burrito or BOGO deals 8-) We all remember when chipotle used to be cool when they first started
124149619252_10152949800154253:Why do people continue to blow this story out of proportion? It was one person....not the whole place.  This is an HR issue and Chipolte cannot discuss this with anyone.  This employee was wrong and should be disciplined and I am sure will be.  Please stop the drama and exaggeration.
124149619252_10151058843154253:A LEED platinum building and yet the exterior overhang lights are on during the day. You guys should get on that.
124149619252_156053474470:Why cant the rest of America enjoy the convenience and joy of the best burritos ever being brought to their homes?
124149619252_10152407734029253:My kids and I ate there at least once a week, to the tune of about $30 per visit on average. So, for 52 weeks, that's almost $1600 a year. Now, multiply that by ..... how many people are never eating here again? Additionally, compare the number of people who have spoken out against your decision in relation to the number of people who are promising their business.....You. Lost.
124149619252_10153872104594253:Chipotle Mexican Grill is the worst company ON THIS PLANET!!! I have never seen such a backward company in my whole life. Incompetent staff all the way around. Everytime I get in contact with your company I get so FRUSTRATED!!! Why do you do that to your customers???!!! It would be better for everyone if you just SHUT DOWN THE WHOLE THING!!!!!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Cindi Czulno-Van Luchene.. Sounds like you have to buy something and then get a coupon for another visit?
124149619252_10152453918534253:So celebrities can get free chipotle for a year? Why not soldiers or Purple Heart recipients people that do more.
124149619252_167132760066216:Stopped at Chipotle.                       Ordered a quesadilla.                      Nom nom nom nom nomm!
124149619252_10152560126959253:Chicken burrito bowl with pinto bean lettuce guacamole mild and medium salsa corn cheese and white rice
124149619252_10153009001449253:I didn't read it I just saw get a free burrito, bowl etc lol Carole Ann Driscoll... I agree I wouldn't buy tofu for that eww
124149619252_10153872104594253:I <3 you Chipotle & was there on the 2nd day your stores reopened in Oregon.  I'm no fair-weather customer!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak Burrito Bowl with brown rice, black beans, fajitas veggies, corn, the hottest salsa, lettuce, and on top of that I put some beautiful squeezed lemon juice and chipotle tabasco.
124149619252_10152883478794253:I will never eat at Chipotle again. The service has gone down the toilet anyway,  so this was just last straw for me. TERRIBLE experiences the last few times we went.
124149619252_10153246130479253:To everyone saying that they will skyrocket in price, I don't think that will be the case. They are a company, they do extensive studies to see what their demographics are and what they are willing to pay. Yes, the price might go up a little (say, a dollar or so), but certainly not to $18 (I know it was an exaggeration, but still). I think this is an excellent move on Chipotle's behalf. Thank you, Chipotle!
124149619252_10151058843154253:Don't know where this one is, but I know you ought to bring one to Evansville, Indiana! C'mon, chipotle! Bring it to us!
124149619252_213189592025031:Again, I said why I call names. If you choose to stay ignorant to what we, as a whole, do, then thats fine. But understand that you will be treated as such, Sir.
124149619252_164816057005566:Please put this in all of the restaurants. I'm over in Indiana, very far from California. I really want to try this..
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito bowl all the way: but will have to go to veggie since just discovered yesterday how high the fat content is with the meat....
124149619252_10153009001449253:I'm not paying 6-8 dollars for a tofu burrito.... That's just wrong on so many levels Victoria Sease Adams
124149619252_10152935096524253:I got $50 in chipotle gift cards! Yum. One comment, while the food is #1 the sweet tea brew fails to reach my expectations, making noodles & co, panera, and chick filet, better places to get something to drink. Let's get a tea drinker in there to give some guidance :)
124149619252_10153319767964253:Just wanted to say that my son tried several times tonight to enter the contest for the scholarship and even though it was well before the 11:59 pm ct deadline, the contest was closed early. The rules stated 11:59 but the website was closed a long time before that. It made my son very sad as he had worked on it for quite some time and was following the rules stated.
124149619252_10153240834269253:Now that you've figured out GMO, can you finally bring PORK back? How long can it take to find a farm that produces pork? I think you have an alternate agenda here.......
124149619252_10151089035244253:Fayetteville, AR which is 30 minute away from where I live,  Need one more in Bentonville, AR  very close to Walmart .... I bet it would  beat all other food courts !!
124149619252_10152935096524253:I personally would make a public spectacle of an employee who had such a negative impact on my business. Until Chipolte grows a spine and publicly announces what action was taken against this employee, I will refrain from any support of Chipolte. It is not acceptable to simply state that you are not at liberty to discuss the "appropriate" actions taken. Depending on how an individual qualifies "appropriate", this could mean that the employee was promoted to assistant CEO. Due to the broad spectrum of what "appropriate" is I am unable to make an educated determination with regards to an appropriate supplier for my burrito diet. For now I will simply use your competitors.
124149619252_10153708605069253:For those commenting, the chipotles a city over from us had an ecoli thing at it. But as I type this I am in line at Chipotles ordering  burrito at our local chipotles. I'm not worried about the ecoli. I'm a loyal fan and unlike many people I realize EVERY food place has its share of issues.   To stop going there forever just because of this shows how sad people are. Some of the places alot of you eat like McDonalds have health violations ALL THE TIME. But yet you still eat there. Only reason this is in the news is because its a popular place. People already know mcdonalds is bad for them so its not shocking when ecoli happens there. And yesit has happened there and more places then you think in the past. Yet you people still support those places.   Actually ecoli aside, if the food at Chipotles gives you an upset stomach its probably because normally you eat unhealthy food and your body doesn't know what to do with the sudden helpings of healthy food. Blame yourselves not the restauraunt.   On that note I should point out going out to eat is a risk, to drive, to buy something...etc is always risky. And yet we do that every day. So stop acting like this ecoli mess is somehow diffrent. Odds are you will get in an accident in a car before getting ecoli at chipotles.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Read the article carefully. Not a single advantage or health benefit of going GMO-free was given. I am certainly open to arguments about the harms of GMOs, but I wasn't presented any. Conversely, Chipotle's prices may go up, so this is just mildly bad news overall.
124149619252_10152949800154253:I sooo agree with Lesa.....my family and I will not be patronizing this business until I see an apology AND a disciplining of those employees involved in this deplorable act of the worst possible behavior.
124149619252_454413931302356:Very strange that someone like TheUnder Dogue would come here and say "support what you wish."  Well, Chipotle WAS supporting the Boy Scouts, but no longer.  So does that go with "don't support who you wish" like so many other businesses who do not give their money to the Boy Scouts? Is TheUnder Dogue going to go to other businesses who do not give money to the Boy Scouts, or ask around as a condition of doing business with someone?  Seriously?  There are just too many people out there who never make any sense at all.  I am so glad they are not in charge of my life...it would be a disaster, I can tell.  I will say it again:  do not give your money to things that insult your soul.
124149619252_10152406485254253:Thank you!  It's so sad that so many people feel that the answer to everything is to talk tough and threaten others for no reason at all.
124149619252_10150719072154253:I work hard and im thankful to have Easter off to spend time with my loved ones. Thank you Chipotle and happy Easter
124149619252_157777224183:Good for you Chip. I'd love to assemble a solar system on the house but its just too costly for a homeowner to do it for now.
124149619252_10152406485254253:Thank you for trying to create a family friendly--actually person friendly-- environment in your restaurants.  
124149619252_10151086390274253:Can no one read Chipotle's post? They didn't say they had won they said she was getting ready for the gold medal match. They didn't give the spoiler everyone else did.
124149619252_10151089035244253:if i could find one where the music wasn't ear-splitting...that would be my favorite location.  and i guess that makes me old.
124149619252_10152724330769253:sure. as long as I don't have to sit next to that guy. he seems to be enjoying his bottle of water way too much.
124149619252_10152250518069253:idk why they went with "no such thing as a free burrito" message -- they give free burritos for other things like dressing up on halloween or other weird stuff
124149619252_212886842115332:Got our burrito's last night with the kiddo's! Thanks Chipotle.... saved me a TON of money! And for being so busy, the employess at our store (Macedonia Oh.) Were amazing! Love your food... keep up the good work!
124149619252_10152621408854253:How about an invention to always get the same amount of chicken in my bowl. Every time I get a highschool girl scooping my chicken, it's sad how little chicken she thinks is appropriate
124149619252_304647552888073:I am so excited they are building a chipiotle in Xenia, Ohio!!!!! That made my day when I seen it!!!!
124149619252_10151192106409253:I just entered the "Chipotle Halloween Costume Contest" and need your vote to help me win.  You can view my entry and vote for me here: http://boorito.votigo.com/contests/voteformyentry/1345103?sk=ehr+z%26fb%3D48602252  Thanks and wish me luck!  Shams
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Fajita Burrito - Chicken, Fajita mix, white rice, Corn sauce, cheese, lettuce. I eat two of them.
124149619252_10153554915464253:Love your food but, you should have free chips, not charge for them. Baja Fresh gives free chips, they're pretty cheap.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl with extra white rice, black beans, chicken, pico, corn salsa and guac! Best guac anywhere, Mad Mex who?? Hahah oh and how did I forget the jalapeno Tabasco!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Quick question -- what are you doing about the cheese used in most of your products?  In Europe and the U.S., the majority of cheese is produced using a genetically engineered form of rennet.
124149619252_10153830182809253:I just heard that Chipotle is trying to change strategies to win back customers. I quit eating there when they changed the recipe for the pinto beans. When the pinto beans went v-gan friendly, they lost the bacon flavor, and that made all the difference. If you bring that back, I'll be back too
124149619252_193346814021706:I don't get it - there's no Joe's High Horse, no attitude. WHO ARE THESE HATERS??  And why are they here, ruining my Chipotle buzz?
124149619252_10151486609219253:Chicken, white rice, grilled veggies,    pico, sour cream, cheese, lettuce.  Would get guac if it wasn't 2 bucks extra.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Oh well lol thanks for clearing that up joe. Won't lie got my hopes up but I knew it was probably fake but you know  chipotle is awesome and seeing that burrito made me hungry so it was worth a try xD and tbh I hope who ever made that fake ad falls in a pit a of lego's agreed?  Lmao
124149619252_10151486609219253:what's wrong with you people obviously you go brown rice because it's healthier and tastes practically the same
124149619252_10152949800154253:I have had that problem on numerous occasions at several Chipotles here in AZ.  It sucks especially when your really hungry!
124149619252_10152407734029253:I will no longer patronize a place that allows open carried weapons. It is threatening and serves no purpose other than provoking a response and a call to 911.
124149619252_100780796665922:I have to add my 2 cents.  Chipotle came first in Denver.  Then it was followed by 2 guys who copied the Chipotle business, calling it Qdoba - again in Denver.  A private equity firm invested in Qdoba and then Qdoba was sold to Jack in the Box whicht is stuggling as a corporation to hold its own.  JACK is interested in being a franchisOR, not in corporate ownership, control or development.  CMG is interested in corporate quality and control across the board.  Go with the original - the guys that do it best - Chipotle.  (I should really work there as much of a cheerleader I am for this company!)
124149619252_164816057005566:OMG YES please bring this to DC... but don't make it as spicy as the tofu at your shophouse in Dupont.
124149619252_10151486609219253:White rice, black beans, corn, pico de gallo, hot sauce, and guacamole. I wish sofritas, too, but it's not available in Houston, Texas.
124149619252_10153896327714253:I'd like all Mexicans demand this place , because they're using the word mexican, while should be called Chipotle US grill
124149619252_10151258924194253:When I lived in Cleveland, I used to go to Chipotle every Friday.  Please allow me to continue that tradition in Bowling Green, KY by opening a restaurant in this area!!  Thanks in advance.
124149619252_10151719407409253:Is it too late to answer puzzle #5? I usually get a text message when the puzzles are unlocked, but I didn't receive one for #5 or #6??
124149619252_10152883474639253:Chipotle is soooo good. But the lines are always long and the app sucks because they never get my order.
124149619252_455264284485429:and ppl think im crazy when i travel over a hour by bus to philly. also been to new york. chipotle, one of the few honest places these days.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Fajita Burrito Bowl: White rice, half steak/half chicken, mild & hot, cheese, extra sour cream, lettuce & guac.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl with brown rice, black beans, mild salsa, and lettuce. Your guac is the best can't forget about that.
124149619252_119322358240818:Hey Billy Combs, as I'm sure you have already learned, unlike at TomBeth farms, many dairies keep their animals confined, often without access to fresh air or sunlight. - Joe
124149619252_10153009001449253:The Northeast needs a snow date for this. I was so looking forward to my Sofritas but a State of Emergency quashed my plans ????
124149619252_10151855292469253:University of Massachusetts Lowell not listed !! Though its just over the 5 mile limit...its a pretty big univ !!
124149619252_10153262094399253:I am a vegan, so I had to look it up, but I can eat there  http://www.peta.org/living/food/6-ways-vegan-chipotle/  Looks delicious
124149619252_10151024826814253:Vegetarian bowl- brown rice, black beans, fajita veggies, pico, corn, guac, light on the sour cream and lettuce...mmmm
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowel, White rice, black beans, corn, cheese and sour cream <3 Chips and salsa on the side :)
124149619252_10152250518069253:So there's no such thing as a free burrito but it's ok to be a volunteer ff and risk my life for no pay everyday? Yah u definitely lost a customer and all my friends with it
124149619252_10153246130479253:There is a huge difference between Genetically Engineered and a Genetically Modified Organism. We have a right to know, label it. http://m.deliciousliving.com/non-gmo/whats-difference-between-ge-and-gmo
124149619252_205082546217004:I <3 me some Chipotle! It seems pretty healthy to me depending on the toppings you ask for. Man... Now Im wanting some Chipotle for dinner!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Levi Sour Diesel...it's really kinda like a smokey chili...kinda...Lol. I've worked for Chipotle for 4 years we just launched it in our town so we got to try it...not bad...had a "different" texture...but over all...not bad!!
124149619252_10152990683604253:Does anyone know when the Wilkes barre pa location is opening? I see the building is coming along good!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Wow, I might actually get to eat out again!   I stopped eating at all restaurants a couple of years ago when I couldn't figure out what was GMO & wasn't.   This is wonderful news!
124149619252_304647552888073:Fantastic!! Ever since my son has been doing the Four our Body he's been eating Burrito Bowls like they are going out of style! :O)
124149619252_10152883478794253:We're sorry to hear we've lost your business, Ryan, and we hope this might help at least explain what happened: http://chip.tl/NYPDStatement -Skyllo
124149619252_10153246130479253:This is so ridiculous. What a a waste of time and energy for something deemed safe, as your page itself states. Curious, will portion size and price stay the same, or do we get to foot the bill for this?
124149619252_10153736393409253:(NaturalNews) After observing recent events involving Chipotle and e.coli, here's my analysis of the situation: Chipotle's e.coli outbreaks are not random chance. They are the result of the biotech industry unleashing bioterrorism attacks against the only fast food company that has publicly denounced GMOs.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Thanks for inflating the unfounded beliefs of science-denialist. Can I get a discount for proving I don't vaccinate?
124149619252_10151024826814253:bowl of loads of white rice & pinto beans, carnitas, sour cream, cheese, mild salsa and guacamole. With a side of chips. MMMM
124149619252_10151024826814253:I miss your food soooooooo much!!!! Wish you were in Santa Rosa, CA. =o( Your steak burrito was the best!!!
124149619252_10153792851004253:Never added the meat because for me it was too much on my bowl. I love the rice and always ask for double with corn, black beans, lettuce. I'm gonna wait a little while longer before I go back. :)
124149619252_290442160968680:This is a nice composition, however I'm sure, a work that picks up a little faster tempo (at least at some point) could be more attractive, catchier for better encouraging & energizing a broader audience to support the admirable cause... for next time;-)
124149619252_10152093036984253:Im just thankful Chipotle took my location request into consideration...best Christmas gift ever even though its not open yet "Its coming to Snellville".
124149619252_10151024826814253:Double wrapped burrito, extra white rice, black beans, extra chicken, mild salsa, corn, extra medium green salsa, and cheese 
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa tacos....black beans, rice,  barbacoa, lettuce, corn salsa, hot salsa, cheese, and sour cream!!!!  Yummmmm!!!!
124149619252_10151089035244253:Vista Ca <3 I live in Oceanside but have 2 go 2 vista for the best service!! Oceanside location and its other new location could be improved 
124149619252_10153001213604253:I love that you stand up for what's right and stopped serving the pork ! I know it must take a lot of profit but u care about the animals!!! I will never stop going to chipotle ! No gmos and no cruelty meat! Love it ! Great job chipotle on showing the other restaraunts how to take an initiative !
124149619252_10152390794454253:You've changed the guacamole. Bad decision. It was gross at my local Chipotle. Not the Avocados either. Definitely a change in recipe. 
124149619252_10151089035244253:Chipotle is one of those rare restaurants where their food exits the body with the same excitement and fire as it entered
124149619252_10153232136249253:ITT: Animal rights activists with nothing better to do.  Hey, let's all conform to Vegetarians and Vegans whims! Let's just stop slaughtering animals for food because maybe 0.01% of the earths population think it's wrong!  Chipotle gave you a meat free option, so you should be satisfied. I could talk all day about how bad some vegan options are. All the vegans I know eat like children.
124149619252_10153780999604253:I hope everyone continues to seek shelter in their doomsday bunkers while I keep enjoying the shorter lines
124149619252_10151973813714253:I had fun working that night at chipotle and seeing everyone's cool costumes! My favorite was this adorable older couple, Bar-ba-ritto and Boorito Bob! SOOO cute!
124149619252_10153892196339253:What do you do when your closest Chipotle is charging 1.80 for tap water? Stop going of course! #scam

124149619252_10153246130479253:If you're bent about GMO's, man are you going to piss yourself when you see how livestock goes from "animal" to "meat".
124149619252_10153009001449253:Went to Chipotle Mexican Grill - West Nyack, New York at about 1900.  Seems you guys decided to give up and go home.
124149619252_10152786808474253:Carnitas (pork), pinto beans, white rice, tomato, corn, and green salsas, cheese, and lettuce. Either in in a bowl or in burrito form if I'm feeling frisky.
124149619252_240071849428248:Still haven't gotten my badge yet :/ I've checked in on Foursquare 3 times since March but still nothing. Is there anything I can do?
124149619252_454413931302356:Good on you guys, a step toward equality. You made the right choice, I know where I'm buying lunch next.
124149619252_10152250518069253:I feel sorry for the poor people who thought it was real when they go try to collect their free burrito.. they will be embarrassed. .
124149619252_10152236327209253:A brand new Chipotle opened in Reno, NV. I would be spend more money with you if Sofritas were added to their menu!
124149619252_156053474470:Can you deliver to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba!?!? I'm really in the need for some Chipotle down here! I'm sure the troops would all approve!
124149619252_10153888324619253:Chipotle's forge on joining people from around the world who are applauding you because you have launched the largest food battle in the history of mankind. "Mankind." That word should have new meaning for all of us today. We can't consume Pond Scum manufactured food anymore!!!!! We will be united in our common interests. Perhaps it's fate that today I plagiarized this speech. still Chipotle will be fighting for our freedom... from tyranny, oppression, and persecution... from annihilation from the billion dollar industry of overly processed food. We are fighting for our right to live. To exist and eat real food. And we will win the day, Soylent Green will no longer be served as an American food we will join the other countries banning GMO's, forever Chipotle and all their supporters declare in one voice: "We will not go quietly into the night!" We will not vanish without a fight! We're going to live on! We're going to survive! Today we celebrate our GMO Independence Day!!!! GO CHIPOTLE I LOVE YOU
124149619252_10152406485254253:Moms will not tolerate engagement our children in your restaurants. End open carrying of weapons in your stores. 
124149619252_365284166822162:This is a pretty sweet deal with a minimum order of 6 burritos and the maximum up to 100!  Now imagine you are an employee at Chipotle preparing all of these orders in one day.  It's a LOT of work and it will go many times slower if people were customizing everything on the burritos. Trust me, this is the best way to do this.
124149619252_100780796665922:Excellent review. I agree whole-heartedly. It pains me every time I see a Qdoba open in my area. Each one is a sad reminder that I have to drive 16 mi to the closest Chipotle. 
124149619252_10152881172544253:We catered Chipotle from our wedding, but had to go all the way to Knoxville, TN from Chattanooga, TN to get it. Wish you guys would hurry up and build us a Chipotle here!
124149619252_209217239092800:I love chipotles in Colorado spring southgate mall. They r always clean fast n Very friendly! My only complaint is no changing station for babys. Keep up the good work guys!
124149619252_10152925087634253:That's pretty cool. A lot of people celebrate Christmas and odds are majority of your employees do too. And for those who dont, they get a day off. Who can complain?
124149619252_10153246130479253:I love chipotle but u guys have been cutting back on portions my last visit the sprinkled the salsa on my salad I could count the tomato pieces that was my last visit
124149619252_185864848093833:@Alli... You really need to read up on your vegan/vegetarian health facts. For those who are true vegans, like myself, most do not have any health issues. Most consume very little cholesterol and very little fat which make their bodies run perfectly.  A fruit and vegetable based diet is not bad for you. Goodness, what a ridiculous thing to say. And to say there aren't enough factory farms to worry about them, wow...take a look at Mercy for Animals web site and do a little research before speaking on the issue. Kudos to Chipotle for at least trying to use better practices in their food preparation. 
124149619252_10151486609219253:Steak burrito. Brown rice, extra pinto beans, extra peppers and onions, extra steak, 2 scoops fresh tomato, 2 scoops hot, lettuce, cheese and sour cream. 
124149619252_10151133894914253:Carol Hairston I hope we can do that someday. In the meantime, we hope you'll come see us at our Huntsville restaurant again soon. - Joe
124149619252_10152408378957741:I love the new sofritas!!!! BUT, servers really need to stop dropping bits of dead animals in the sofritas pan. Yuk!
124149619252_100721346610908:can you pllllllllease build a chipotle in ft. myers florida?!?!? i have 2 drive 2 hours to get my chipotle fix and it sux!!!!!!!!!
124149619252_10152453918534253:Not so sure about the "secret menu." I attempted to get the nachos the other day, and they refused to make them for me. Super bummed!
124149619252_492523374093310:He doesn't want help.  He wants to know that we too have an addition to Chipotle.  We shouldn't make him feel omnipotent!  We should say "Dude, I TOO know what it's like to crave tacos.  I TOO can't uninstall the Chipotle app from my phone".  We should connect with him, through sharing and understanding the concept of Chipotledness Cravings.
124149619252_205455487672:awesome...the brits will love this new wave of food that Americans now clamor to get their buds on...love it!
124149619252_10153001213604253:Left  off menus in some locations due to a supplier who violated its animal  treatment policies. Chipotle has chosen to do the "right" thing in an  industry that is notorious for abusing livestock.
124149619252_156053474470:For those of you who watched south park last week, didn't you know chipotle leaves you with bloody underwear haha?
124149619252_10151024826814253:Naked burrito. White ride, pinto beans, steak, 2 scoops of hot salsa, 1 scoop of corn salsa, sour cream, cheese, a little bit of lettuce, and squeeze some lemon juice on top! Favorite thing ever :) love to scoop it up with chips
124149619252_10151024826814253:chicken burrito bowl with black beans, brown cilantro lime rice, medium salsa, corn salsa, lettuce, and sour cream! YES.
124149619252_10152357093419253:Und ratet mal wo ich gleich essen gehe ???? Tina Wohlgemuth Linda Jonczyk Natalie Feulner Alisa Brosch
124149619252_10153608850569253:Lanqi Wu hmm am not sure why I keep seeing all these Chipotle ads  I think they're sending me a message ????
124149619252_10153009001449253:Maybe next time you run a campaign like this you should ensure your stores have enough product! My husband tried to pick up for dinner and the Libertyville IL location is all out as well.
124149619252_10152949800154253:When the two police officers walked into the Brooklyn Chipotle hoping to enjoy their lunch, they found the employees doing something unbelievably disrespectful.   The employees were standing behind the counter and greeted the officers with their hands raised saying, Hands up, dont shoot. The officers were ignored and not served. The officers decided to avoid these thugs and quietly exited the restaurant.   Chipotle's corporate management has been contacted about this horrific incident but has declined to offer a comment or statement. Since the incident happened, police supporters everywhere are calling for a boycott of the Mexican fast food chain.
124149619252_10153246130479253:So, you're really not changing anything since everything on this planet is a GMO. Oh wait, the prices will go up because the same stuff you bought before will now have an "organic" sticker on it.
124149619252_363324750372027:Chipotle doesn't move their most valuable employees up very fast...they probably lose a lot of good employees because they are not very good at training them?
124149619252_10153246130479253:I hope chipotle has a computer scientist or two to realize that this marketing tactic has backfired..
124149619252_10150959152619253:I just love the fact that I knew this was IAD at first glance...LOVE ME SOME CHIPOTLE...in fact I have it EVERY Wednesday with my FRIENDS...solving the world's problems over a Chipotle chicken bowl!!!! 
124149619252_10151089035244253:I like the ones that say they're open by hanging a banner outside and then actually are open. Unlike the mt. Hope store in Rochester ny
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito with black beans,  salsa, sour cream, cheese, guac and lettuce! delicius uum my favorite
124149619252_10153001213604253:PLEASE open a Chipotle in Salina, KS!!!! I am so craving it right now and the closest one is over an hour away!!
124149619252_10151687038594253:Tracey Garton For one thing, this contest is only unfortunately open to residents of the US and Canada. But if you have additional issues, please note them more specifically with our team at http://chip.tl/re0OLp - Joe
124149619252_346503142066549:I will remind. I am still in active boycott until you open a location in Melbourne, Florida. Why hoard such a wonderful thing?
124149619252_109031815838831:Our family loves chipotle my daughter if we let her would eat it everyday I wish I knew how to make their vinagarette for the salads luv it we put it on burritos bols and salads .I have never had n e thing free offered to me though but that's ok cuz we will always go there
124149619252_10153389325099253:I travel for work. I literally eat at Chipotle every single day, no matter where I am. My friends have called me the long term unofficial mascot for Chipotle.   When I'm on the road, I'll sometimes go out of my way to make sure I have a Chipotle close enough by the end of that work day, so I can have it for dinner if I didn't already have it for lunch. Thank you for providing me with healthy food no matter where I am, because road life can take a toll on your diet and you have literally saved me from it.   Thank You, Chipotle.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Now maybe you can get my new local Chipotle to be at the same level of quality and taste I'm used to!
124149619252_10153656854824253:Auntie Elicia, apparently chipotle guac does have jalapeños... I guess you weren't crazy in thinking it was spicy when you were pregnant. Oops! ??????????????
124149619252_10153088156639253:Perry Pich Franklin Stewart Brittani Ogden Caysie Ogden Jason Cooley Michael Ulib Trevor Bishop  lets go!!
124149619252_10152632602189253:Sometimes I drive out of my way to the next nearest Chipotle Mexican Grill so that I don't creep out the employees at my usual branch by going there too many days in a row.  A chicken burrito bowl is great recovery food while training for IRONMAN!
124149619252_10152022699034253:Super fast on the correct answer Simon Roshdy. Send us a private message when you get a chance. - Joe
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak-chicken, rice, brown beans, corn salsa, extraaa sour cream, lettuce, guacamole,...plss i havent eat chipotle since 2009, pls we nEeD a CHIPOTLe in brownville texas.
124149619252_10151149863494253:Come to the Downtown Des Moines Farmers Market!  It's amazing, we average 18,000 people per Saturday AND you can see me at my booth: Three Chicks Bakery!
124149619252_10152786808474253:I see people complaining about prices. The only thing I don't understand is why tacos are the same as the burrito, I can never justify getting tacos, not even as fulfilling as a bowl.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Just more proof that gmos are not "necessary"  or "better"  -  the rest of the world has already figured it out... Looking forward to America finally getting it. Thank you Chipotle!!!
124149619252_10153246130479253:I thought this already happened..? Fun fact of the day is that all of our food is already genetically-altered. Cross breeding veggies and wheat for a better, more palatable, and more resilient plant has been happening for thousands of years. If you buy a non-gmo organic tomato at whole foods doesn't mean anything. Did you know that regular oranges weren't originally sweet? It's true. Look it up.
124149619252_10152250518069253:The very first time I went to chipotle... It was free! They were excited that it was my first time there so all our meals were free! Totally unexpected surprise! 
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl with the tortilla on the side. White rice, chicken, pinto beans, mild salsa, lettuce, and cheese. With a side order of chips and a Pibb. MMMMMMMM.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Joe, why do you type this with such disdain?  Is that a CORE value of Chipotle's?  It only displays disrespect and discourtesy to your customers, the people who make YOUR paycheck possible.  Perhaps you should remember that the next time you post.
124149619252_10151973813714253:Dustin Jones if you are ever in Beaverton, Or. come on in for a free meal on me! Thanks for your support!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Doesn't matter.  The feed that the livestock feed on  has been genetically altered.  Genetic changes due  to food and  environment is very real. Which means they'll  be genetically altered  anyway.
124149619252_10153656854824253:I worked there and had to make it on a daily basis about 5 batches a day it's not as easy as they show haha but definitely better for ya!
124149619252_109031815838831:Any company that empowers their employees to go above and beyond in the name of customer service gets an A++++++++++++++++++++ in my book! I've never received a whole burrito, but I've been the lucky receiptiant of some free green gold
124149619252_10152250518069253:Its not real cause your food sucks!!!! Many corporate restaurants and even small businesses will offer free food to people to promote their food, guess Chipotle isnt a customer appreciative company
124149619252_10151089035244253:The one I am closest to when I am hungry is my favorite, but I do like the one in Temecula where Maria and Javier are managers.  They always say my name when I walk in and the customers look around and then at me like I am a celebrity.  Haha!
124149619252_10153246130479253:SO ENCOURAGING seeing all the support you're getting for this! 56,000 likes and counting. Consumers are voting with their dollars and we are only going to see these positive changes if we continue to do so! For those still being misled by companies like Monsanto and bullshit bought and paid for science studies , luckily for you, you've got about a billion other choices. For now... Keep up the positive changes Chipotle!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito with rice, carnitas, steak, roasted chili-corn salsa, sour cream, cheese, guac, and lettuce <3
124149619252_10151719407409253:hoax the answers wont submit there is a word missing in the first one and i cant figure this out,   1. Usually when you roll something this good, it's illegal. 2. The Happy Pill. Now in a 567,000 mg dose. 3. Open wide, no wider. 4. The gourmet restaurant where you eat with your hands. 5. They beep when they backup.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak burrito, whit rice, no beans, mild salsa, corn, lettuce, extra cheese and extra sour cream and a large Coke with lemon. ^_^ Mmmmmm yum. Just had one today.
124149619252_10153009001449253:all out of sofritas in TAMPA-HydePark location also, but will honor receipt deal. Terribly planned marketing stunt. This is a bad bump in our relationship, Chipotle!!!
124149619252_10153555173409253:Chipotle should add seasonal items, like roasted butternut squash for fall and mango salsa for summer. Etc.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Too bad GMO food has been proven time and time again to be safe for human consumption. Just another marketing ploy at the expense of hardworking farmers.
124149619252_175763983493:I don't take much stock of the whole Global Warming theory, but for a couple months of Chipotle burritos, I'll do a $10K budget production greener than Kermit's ass!
124149619252_10152883486474253:Thanks for the vegan products and for maintaining high standards for the meat you still use. At least you stand for something. I have not been a Chipotle customer (just never tried it), but I am going to become one since hearing about your vegan choices and your standards. I will be ordering a sofrita on the 26th and then bringing back my receipt later. Thanks!
124149619252_10151053134024253:Coolest?  I found the London store a few months before it opened and could not WAIT until I could sink my teeth into a burrito in the UK!  That was amazing:)  But the coolest was a the Burlington MA store last October when I had 'see ya later' burrito with my husband before he left for Afghanistan and then again 6 months later when I had a 'welcome home' burrito.  That was the coolest, ever.
124149619252_10150262089049253:YAY!!! Chef's Garden is awesome!! Thanks for using something grown locally, because Sandusky is sure happy to have our own Chipotle!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Congratulations to a franchise that markets and sells real food with real nutrition....F%$# McDonalds et al with their cold plastic drawer hockey pucks and plastic cheese (Culvers is an exception marvelous).....
124149619252_10152805746454253:Chicken, rice, pintos, mild and corn salsa, cheese, sour cream, ummm let's not forget chips n guacamole!
124149619252_10150399959924253:I'll admit, it does seems a bit self-serving that Chipotle would pick the costume that appears to pays more tribute to their advertising department than actual American farmers. That being said, in spite of many people getting upset that such unrelatable costumes were picked, if they wouldn't have picked this as the winning costume, most the people on here probably would have never seen this commercial (which did have a good message) and most advertising campaigns/giveaways are targeted at raising brand awareness, so what's the harm? Chipotle became what it is today through it's branding and making some of the best burritos on the block. Everyone who didn't win still got a burrito for $2 as a consolation prize... So why are so many people upset? Congrats to the winners and thanks to Chipotle for keeping me well fed on food not made in a test tube.
124149619252_10151809543439253:If Chipotle added the veggie esquites bowl to the menu here in Phoenix, I would probably eat there like 3 times a week!
124149619252_199537401806:Jacksonville, NC.  The nearest one is in Raleigh, 3 hours away!  Urgh......this is a military town and I know there are alot of folks around here that need their Chipotle fix too!
124149619252_10153296787694253:You've had a sign that your out of pork for about 4 weeks now.  When's it coming  back???? I haven't heard of a shortage of pigs.
124149619252_10151587164929253:Thank you for beginning the process of labeling GMOs in your food and eventually phasing them out.   Hopefully this will be a positive and attainable example for other restaurants to follow.
124149619252_205455487672:what sucks... and is so good about Chipotle, is that they won't go anywhere where they can't easily get the incredible, all natural ingredients they need.....
124149619252_10153246130479253:http://welovegv.com/entries/gmos/earthdayorganic if Chipotle cared about the environment they would embrace technology.
124149619252_10153388589524253:Excellent - a fresh tortilla over store bought tasting ones would throw Chipotle over the top awesome
124149619252_10151486609219253:3 - 4 scoops of brown rice, 2 - 3 scoops of beans, chicken and extra cheese all in a burrito bowl with 3 tortillas on the side all for $6.25 + tax and I wrap my own using the bowl.
124149619252_10151046444064253:Had a chicken bowl yesterday AND today - just LOVE the flavor of the chicken - what makes it taste so darned good?
124149619252_10152883478794253:I read your response it is still not good enough!! I will never step foot in any of your restaurants again.
124149619252_10151089035244253:Signal butte road in Mesa, AZ. It rocks! We love the manager Nancy too!!!! Yummy! Yummy to delicious and nutritious Chipolte!
124149619252_10151486609219253:white rice, black beans, chicken, mild salsa, corn salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce.  who knows? sometime might try a different type of meat or add a little more variety to my burritos at chipotle.
124149619252_10151089035244253:We need one on the shoreline in CT - New Haven, East Haven, Branford, Guilford or Madison.  Please - Milford is too far to go.
124149619252_10153096213679253:Joseph... Enter this. It's an amazing festival. Art, music, and all you can eat Chipotle and other food. ????
124149619252_131676086962937:I am not sure what it is that I am doing wrong...I am following your page on foursquare and I have checked in at least 3 times since liking the page but I did not get any badage....I am not sure what it is that i am missing to do...=/
124149619252_10151258924194253:SO glad to hear there is still some companies out there that believe it is ok to close a full day for the holiday!!!! WAY TO GO CHIPOTLE!!!!
124149619252_10151658877254253:After reading that you label your ingredients as to which are G(MO), H(ydrogenated oils), and P(reservatives) on your website, I know where I am having lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for setting the example and hopefully you can continue to cut those letters off your ingredient list.  I will say it would be nice to know if it is different for the incidental items listed in grey underneath the ingredients.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Veggie bowl, pinto and black beans, pico de gallo, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, hot sauce, top off with fresh squeezed lime juice!
124149619252_10152250518069253:Qdoba has coupons,rewards free lunch programs they are just as good people!!!!as we see chipotle has no loyalty to customers.
124149619252_10153246130479253:So, your meat is still fed GMO feed.  Your soda is still HFCS from GMO corn.  I suspect your margarita mix is too.  Your beer is brewed with GMO yeast.  Your cheese is made with GMO bacteria with milk from cows fed GMO.    This is an honest question. What does McDonalds have that is GMO that you don't?  Lettuce - nope * tomatoes - nope * potatoes - nope ** corn - McDonalds doesn't serve corn except in their soda, same as Chipotle Beef - nope # Chicken - nope # Pork - nope # Pickles - nope * Apples - nope ** dairy - nope  # flour - nope * onions - nope *  * No GMO varieties available ** GMO varieties available or soon to be available, but McDonalds has explicitly stated it will not use them # Animals are fed GMO feed, same as Chipotle
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito- brown rice, extra cilantro, a little bit of pinto beans, chicken, medium salsa, cheese, corn, salad dressing, all 3 tabasco side sauces, squirt of lemon. Eat it open face with a Pibb on the side :)
124149619252_10153246130479253:How about a chain restaurant that doesn't use electricity or any other technology which has caused undue paranoia.
124149619252_157777224183:Had a thought... I had better not be paying for a more expensive burritos b/c they want to be GREEN....
124149619252_130482563683418:I like Chipotle, but they aren't the only game in town. If you are in the Dayton Ohio area, check out Hot Head Burrito. They beat out Chipotle in a recent popularity contest. Absolutely  worth a try.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito - pinto beans, rice, medium salsa, sour cream, cheese, and guacamole! The BOMB!! South San Diego needs a chipotle! 
124149619252_10150256700954253:They FINALLY put a store in Memphis; I ate there twice in three days.  It would have been three times in three days, but they were closed on July 4.
124149619252_10152108930454253:Boo I need Chipotle 24/7 you guys should never close... I need a burrito for breakfast, lunch and dinner
124149619252_199537401806:Open one in Grand Forks, Noth Dakota...I don't know if I can survive any longer without a Chipotle in my college town :(
124149619252_10153009001449253:Ok Reece, here's the plan, you order the sofritas, and I'll get the free burrito :) this is such a good plan.
124149619252_10150959152619253:I'm pretty sure its the one at the airport. They have breakfast chipotle with eggs and potatos and brakfast burritos! So good.
124149619252_10151089035244253:Grant and Swan in tucson az! store number 0085, its my store! :) im one of the kmit's there and we're really changing things up. i invite anyone in the area to come in  so we can proudly serve you fast and with a smile, all the while upholding our food with integrity standards.

124149619252_10151024826814253:I call it "Double Clean and Hot" - Burrito Bowl with Brown Rice, Double Black-Beans, Double Fajitas, Guac, and Lettuce.  I take it back to the office where I put on a layer of Habanero, Ghost Pepper, or Trinidad Scorpion Chili Powder.
124149619252_10153830182809253:When is this E Coli thing gonna end?! -_______- I'm getting sick of just hearing about it -_____- I've been wanting some Chipotle so bad lately >:(

124149619252_10152250518069253:You absolutely owe EVERYONE who commented on this obtuse post a FREE LUNCH!  You are, in fact, UNPROFESSIONAL and obnoxious for the manner in which this post is written!

124149619252_10150637170574253:Cincinnati would like the Chipotles here to please add red, yellow, and orange peppers to the fajita mix.  Well, I would, anyway.  :D

124149619252_363324750372027:I didn't check in this month but I'm at Chipotle ATLEAST 6 times a month! Add 12 years to that, I should get free food regardless!! 
124149619252_10153389325099253:I'm not. The closest Chipotle is just south of Downtown Nashville, and I live in Hendersonville, so I am forced to visit the local taco shack. It's really good (if you like authentic street tacos), but sometimes I really crave Chipotle. :(
124149619252_10151486609219253:Extra corn salsa and extra sour cream! Wish you did the fajita onions and bell peppers separately or more onions than peppers. :(
124149619252_10153246130479253:This is why I love Chipotle so much! If you guys are really opening up in Layton, UT I am determined to get a job there. :)
124149619252_10152406485254253:Thank you, Chipotle, for not letting a bunch of extreme radicals create an unsafe environment in your restaurants!  My family and I eat at Chipotle on a regular basis and I'm glad I don't have to change that.  As to all the "customers" who are saying they will go elsewhere:  Good-bye and good riddance!!
124149619252_10153693560944253:Hey Chipolte Mexican Grill:  Gee.. you truly have tremendous food and I go to your restaurant on "South Florida Avenue - Lakeland, FL" and I always order the "Bowl" meal.  I was wondering if you have a place on your website to sign up as a member and do you offer any deals for "Veteran's" like myself or "Birthday Deals"???
124149619252_10151024826814253:Soft tacos with brown rice, black beans, chicken, mild salsa, a touch of medium, corn, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, & guacamole on the side. AMAZING!!!
124149619252_10150719072154253:Thank you for respecting the holiday! I hope your employees enjoy this day together with their friends and family.
124149619252_10151058843154253:the Chipotle would not give a donation or gift card for Justin poker run.....................................
124149619252_10153009001449253:Amber Abreu too bad the lady there knows I get it all the time already ???? im sure she'd still give it to me lol
124149619252_10153423452749253:Bobbie Jenniges Willer mom WALK THE MOON- those are the people who sing Shut a up and Dance! We have to go!!!!!
124149619252_10153246130479253:Just remember, 98% of all corn grown in the US is genetically modified. Guess you have to stop eating corn and all products produced with it. You housewives need to go back you your TV shows.
124149619252_10153246130479253:It's about time?   Wow................  And here I thought it was about changing the way people think about and eat fast food     ¯\_(?)_/¯
124149619252_10151024826814253:Salad! 1/2 Chicken 1/2 Steak, brown rice, fajitas, mild and hot sauce, sour cream, cheese and guac with a order of chips to scoop up the goodness 
124149619252_10153009001449253:I love Sofritas!  I have it all the time. Went to my local Chipotle after work at 830 and I  ordered 2 Sofritas burritos.  She told me they were out and I  said *Nooooo  don't say that!  Lol she told me I  could do 2 with a meat of my choice and the next ones will still be free.  I told her I don't eat meat so she gave me guacamole instead.  I'm glad so many people tried it,though!  This way at least it will be available at the other locations and not everyone will be going on the same day!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Last time I was there I asked for a small sample. It was actually really good!!  I was shocked out how flavorful it was. (My minimal experience with tofu has been bland at best)
124149619252_10152084246179253:I thought about it. But then I remembered all the times I started hating the places where I worked so much that I STILL do not go to some of the businesses. I do not want to hate Chipotle.
124149619252_134085872963:white kid trying to be gangsta + hip hop = absolute crap If this won 2nd place... the other ones must've even crappier lol
124149619252_10151024826814253:1/2 chicken 1/2 carnitas bowl, extra white rice, easy pinto beans, medium green sauce, corn, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce! :P
124149619252_10153367597019253:Thank you for giving healthy fast food options to families in America!  One less argument with my tween daughter! Kudos!
124149619252_10151906029579253:Sami Rose Sapp you...me and our men (unless samuel works halloween) should do this....yup...and if he does work then we should still go atleast...plus youll already be dressed up from work!!
124149619252_10151058843154253:The windows add natural lighting, decreasing the need for electric lighting. Some or all power is supplied by a windmill on top of the building. A bike rack encourages people to ride their bikes. LEED points could also be given if there are parking spaces for carpools and for fuel efficient vehicles, etc.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa bowl with rice, black beans, fajita veggies, lettuce, sour cream, cheese, hot and mild salsa
124149619252_10153009001449253:Just had some in Port St. Lucie, Florida. It was delicious, it just became my favorite. Please make it a permanent item on your menu!
124149619252_10153246130479253:I didn't know you were serving GMO products at first. I watched a documentary on Netflix that said everything was organic. Or maybe I was mistaken. Good for you. I love your basic menu and the great tastes of the food!
124149619252_10152250518069253:I can't believe how many people actually thought that was real! Then again, I forgot that you can't post anything on the Internet that isn't true ;)
124149619252_10153246130479253:Well there goes any hope for a burrito genetically engineered to NOT give me burning hot lava poops. Thanks for ruining my life food babe.
124149619252_10153602183249253:Pretty crappy of people. Then again, the similar ad The Onion made for Subway was even worse... so bad it was... kinda funny.
124149619252_10152406485254253:Next thing you will offer is discounts to anyone that is NOT, white, conservative and Christian.   Stick to food.
124149619252_10151719407409253:This was my favorite so far.  I Didn't have enough time to finish it today before the next puzzle so this was most likely the day I would have been randomly selected for the 1 year free burrito.  My closest chipotle is 2.5 hours away. :(
124149619252_10152990683604253:I wish the one we will no longer go to would of gotten their act together. Started last year with someone in the back eating while preparing food. Then another time when they wouldn't redeem our gift card. Then when we went back and they said they would accept it, they didn't listen to our order and got everything wrong, so we left. And now this last time when everything we got was COLD.. not oh gee it's a little cold. Everything in my bowl was cold. There have only been a few employee's that we have seen that care about their work. The rest just don't seem to care.  We will no longer be going to this store. And the only other ones are three towns over, so it looks like we won't be going to any of them anytime soon unless we happen to be over in that area.  Really sucks because we love Chipotle Mexican Grill.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Understandable, however I eat at the chipotle near my house at LEAST three times a week, with the string of complaints that I have for each and every time that I visit this location, I should have free Chipotle for a year!!!!
124149619252_10151961054499253:Nestor...they are NOT non-gmo. Their soybean, canola, and corn oil are all gmo. Maybe even more but those are what a rep admitted to me in an e-mail. Which means pretty much anything you get has gmo oil in or on it. However, they have claimed that they are trying to go non-gmo.
124149619252_109031815838831:Something similar to this actually happened to me at a Chipotle once. Just last week actually. Is it company policy or something, or do you just hire nice people?
124149619252_10153009001449253:Seriously people try it. I am a straight up meat eating machince. I hate vegan products. I always get steak when I go to Chipotle. I tried the Sofritas and honestly it's now my favorite thing. If you haven't tried it ask for a sample. It's  freaking amazing which makes the special a good deal
124149619252_10153792851004253:Chipotle, could you please get some "sissy sauce" for us sissy's that want some extra flavor but can't handle the heat???   There is a restaurant in Albuquerque, New Mexico named "Rudy's" and they have a "sissy sauce."
124149619252_10153296787694253:Anthony, Geeyan, Rodel, Drew, Danielle, Julio, Josh, Gerard, tag Virginia photos with these hashtags! :D

124149619252_10152250518069253:There's a "fill out this survey and get a $25 Chipotle gift card" scam too! They put you on a 100 call lists!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl, lite brown rice, steak (sometimes extra steak), no beans (too filling), tomato salsa, tomatillo green chili, sometimes cheese, guacamole and lettuce. Just had it today :))
124149619252_10153246130479253:Bravo! I will now be eating at Chipotle during my lunch breaks. I've been anti GMO for years, since the 1990s, and I'm more certain than ever that they are bad news. Even in the unlikely event that they don't harm human health, they still cause genetic contamination of ecosystems all over the planet, with consequences that could be truly grotesque. Those who peddle GMOs will say/do anything for an extra nickel in profit.
124149619252_10151486609219253:they're supposed to be removed, but sometimes one will sneak it's way in there. they're technically edible, just not the best texture. also, they're a great source of antibiotics
124149619252_10152571682409253:Herbalife is everywhere Jamie King!! When your the biggest and the best nutrition company in the world people want what you got!! So let's get you on board!!!
124149619252_156053474470:OMG soooo many times that I wanted a chipotle burrito but didn't have the time to drive and wait 20+ minutes in line for one.  This would solve that.
124149619252_279121798773401:Dear Chipotle by my house:  Please have FRESH guac...every time I go it is looking pretty brown so I don't buy it :(
124149619252_10152104828699253:I had a Chipotle burrito bowl at the Maple and Ridge Rd. store in Wichita this afternoon!  Love Chipotle!!
124149619252_10153693560944253:I seriously doubt your statements regarding safety when I see the cook in your Rancho Cordova, CA restaurant handling his cellphone with his gloves on while standing at the grill cooking.  The cellphone I'm sure is handled while he is at home in bed, on the toilet, doing yard work, etc..
124149619252_10153009001449253:Attention vegetarians and the like:  If you take up this offer and have no interest in the free "meat" burrito, kindly mail your reciept to me,  a carnivore, so that i may eat free burritos for a month. Thank you for your leafy contributions.  Tommy Dean
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa burrito, brown rice, fajita, mild salsa, a little medium green, extra sour cream, cheese, lettuce, and guacamole. That is the best combination ever!
124149619252_10152084246179253:So excited i just applied for your store in Rockaway NJ !! Hope to hear some good news! Love Chipotle !!
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito bol, steak, black beans, fajita, corn and hot salsa, and lots and lots of lettuce.. always say that exact order every time..
124149619252_10153349214189253:Let's open Chipotle n the Conyers, Covington, Decatur, Lithonia, Stone Mountain area. That's Georgia baby.
124149619252_10152883478794253:use to be my go to place but no more.  the actions of your employee were appalling as was your response to the situation.  There is nothing you can do to correct this mess.
124149619252_10151258924194253:Thank you for respecting your employees! As a frequent customer, I am happy to know my support is going to a decent company.
124149619252_10153246130479253:Woot woot for NON GMO's!!! NOW YOU HAVE MY ATTENTION AND I THANK YOU??? Hopefully prices stay the same

124149619252_10151089035244253:It's not really my favorite location but rather my closest location. They aren't really that friendly in there and complain when you order things even though it's exactly as it's written on the menu. I still go though because I love the food (I just hate the service).
124149619252_10151024826814253:bowl:brown rice,steak,fajita veggies,medium salsa,pico de gallo,black beans, sour cream,cheese,lettuce and guacamole!! <3 <3 i want sum right now!!

124149619252_10151024826814253:Double-wrapped burrito with double barbacoa, brown rice, double cheese, corn salsa, and a blackberry Izze on the side. :)
124149619252_10151486609219253:The gay lobby professes tolerance yet they are the most intolerant of all of the hate groups out there.  They use intimidation to force their beliefs on others and now Chipotle is complicit in this behavior...you are not deserving of my hard earned money...in fact thank you I am writing a check to the BSA right now!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Steak tacos, soft shell with mild salsa, lettuce, little cheese and sour cream.  YUM! my favorite lunch!!
124149619252_10152406485254253:Reaver McFakename, no one cares. Not even Chipotle cares.   If you are so distraught because you're not allowed to kick open Chipotle's doors like an Old West Saloon and fire off a few rounds into the air, well, I don't think Chipotle will miss you.  You'll also want to seek psychiatric care.
124149619252_10151486609219253:Brown rice, black and pinto beans, chicken, hot salsa, sour cream, corn, cheese, and lettuce; and I sometimes get a bowl too!
124149619252_10151058843154253:Man, its great to visit the original Chipotle in Denver and then eat at the other great Colorado born restaurant, Noodles and Company!!!
124149619252_10153215460149253:I think it would be really funny if this festival exclusively fed people gmo without notifying them. To see if a single person in the audience could tell a difference.
124149619252_10152394598154253:I concur with Keith Morris Washington! I cannot frequent an establishment that allows such nonsense. What has happened to society's common sense?
124149619252_10153246130479253:Suuuuuure they are.....they can say it all day long that theybwont use gmo's but in the end you never know for a fact....are they raising their own animals now and growing own veggies and rice?
124149619252_10153246130479253:So what are the side effects from massive doses of aluminum in the stratosphere combined with soil contamination from glyphosate??http://file.scirp.org/Html/5-3000951_53106.htm
124149619252_10153872104594253:I appreciate that you all were trying to make up for making people sick, but its pretty crummy that it lasted all of like 5 seconds. Chipotle was my favorite place to eat quick for a long time, but i will admit, i was one of those customers that were a bit taken aback by headlines of mass poisoning and opted out of eating in your stores until it was figured out. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Facebook stories of Chipotle giving away $1 BURRITOS to make up for their mishap surface and spread like wildfire. You can only imagine my excitement, I knew Chipotle wouldn't let us down. Only to be followed by the biggest let down yet. "Awww, too late. Just missed out. Too bad." Thats f***ing awesome. Of course none of those headlines make their way to the people until its 2 weeks too late. Needless to say, I'm beyond disappointed. So here's my formal complaint to you, before I decide whether or not to take my business elsewhere. #roburrito #bajafresh #qdoba #chipotlesslippin
124149619252_160584150738666:I love Chipotle, but you guys need to strike a deal with one of the major nationwide truck stops so we can enjoy it more often.  Bring Chipotle to America's truckers!
124149619252_10152250518069253:I remember when you used to do a "BOGO free" advertised on the FB page a few years ago...that was a treat!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Salad with double black beans, brown rice, and all the veggies. No cheese, no sour cream. Awwwyeahhh.
124149619252_10151258924194253:how about open some facilities in germany? ever since my 2 week stay almost 2 years ago im missing chipotle like hell
124149619252_213189592025031:Lots of scientists back me up on it. YOu should do some reading. Quit calling people morons. What do you care if myself and every friend and family member I can reach don't participate in this fraud.
124149619252_105860719543628:Life is Burritofull !!!! proud 2 b part of this incredible family !!!! Food with integrity ... We care

124149619252_10153246130479253:Thank you for going Non GMO!! Your one of the only food companies that have morals and are fighting for what's right and not for what's cheaper and popular.
124149619252_10153009001449253:The location "near" me must have seriously misjudged the amount of people that would be interested in trying these. As a Vegan, I don't usually eat at places like this but wanted to give it a try because it's, well, Tofu. Went quite a bit out of my way (about 10 miles) only to find out that they ran out of Tofu. Just a bit disappointed. Oh, well.
124149619252_182078509223:why aren't you doing all of this new stuff in Colorado where you got your start? We've been with Chipotle since day 1! Give us the good stuff!
124149619252_10153792851004253:Great article that will help those who now fear Chipotle to understand what is going on http:// www.naturalnews.com/052405_Chipotle_ecoli_outbreak_corporate_sabotage_biotech_bioterrorism.html

124149619252_10153009001449253:I bought a sofritas burrito and got charged for a steak and receipt says steak. What am I to for my free burrito now?
124149619252_10153351140389253:Way to go! Like your food and I will be eating more often now that you insure your employers and offer tuition  reimbursement. Good job
124149619252_10153867363919253:Chipotle my advice is to also train your people to provide  GOOD customer service, I think their attitude was what caused ecoli!!      Last time I was the meat was cold! Let's get this fixed ! We don't wanna loose you.
124149619252_205455487672:Oh my god i miss chipotle! Im living in johannesburg, south africa and i crave chipotle at LEAST once a day! PLEASE open one here soon!
124149619252_10153734396969253:I am not eating at any Chipotle anymore. I do not want to catch e-coli or norovirus.  I'll make my lunch at home from now on.
124149619252_183772721660585:Seriously folks, he's done a fine job. Thank you Steve Ellis, and good luck! Acknowledgement is well deserved. ...I am more than happy to eat at Chipotle. (Gluten free, fresh, healthy, great prices ... ) Appreciate it very much.
124149619252_205082546217004:Chipotle started in Denver, CO and at one point, like Panda Express, was purchased by McDonald's. However, Steve Ellis bought it back from McDonald's a few years ago, and now once again runs his great restaurant
124149619252_205082546217004:i dont think chipotle and "healthfulness" should be used in the same sentence---as delicious as chipotle is
124149619252_10153246130479253:Hey Chipotle, how about doing something to ACTUALLY improve the health of your customers, such as lowering the sodium content in your food?
124149619252_10151258924194253:This is awesome!!   I love Chipotle before and I love you even more now thank you so much for doing this!!
124149619252_10151486609219253:I like the burrito bowl - brown rice, black beans, barbacoa, mild and medium salsa, some cheese and guacamole.  YUM!!
124149619252_10153009001449253:So heres my question. Is it possible for me to get a burrrito/bowl and get sofritas but also get chicken? And by that i mean double meat. And would the offer still be valid to be able to get a free burrito the next visit with the receipt?
124149619252_10152560126959253:Chicken bowl, extra white rice, extra tomato salsa, guacamole and lettuce. YUM!!  we had Chipotle for dinner last night.
124149619252_10153009001449253:The sofritas are so delicious!!  This is a perfect opportunity for people to try them!  (Even those who are "afraid" of tofu.)  :)
124149619252_10152560126959253:Mine is a bowl with white rice, pinto beans, chicken, tomato salsa, corn salsa, sour cream & cheese with chips & guac on the side! Mmmmm! :) I had it last night for dinner! :)
124149619252_10153806089609253:That's a nice helping of guac. Yumm. I get bowl, light brown rice, veg, black bean, salsa galore, light cheese and guac. Mmmm~ I've had die-hard carnivores melt under that recipe. <3

124149619252_10152323527922741:Disrespectful of the many family farms that supply the raw materials for the Chipotle food you all are consuming.

124149619252_10150959152619253:Not in Israel were you guys can seriously make a killing, cause there are so many americans in jerusalem and tel aviv that are dying to eat chipotle here!!! So common business plan and lets move forwards!!
124149619252_322643590240:in CIncinati we have like 8 million chipotles AND WE NEED MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! RAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
124149619252_10153236016399253:Just put one near me! Do you have any idea how far the nearest one is? I do. Build one in Gardner, MA. Take my money!
124149619252_178542422170361:When is the new one in Colma, CA opening?  I keep driving by and it says "Opening Soon".  Great spot, I'll be there often!!  Can you offer a salsa without onions?  Or get sliced tomatoes?
124149619252_10152560126959253:I all way get a bowl chicken, brown rice, blacc beans, fajitas, chicken, tomatoes, corn, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, and guacamole and extra cheese, and sour cream in a cup
124149619252_279121798773401:This just had to pop up...I've been at college for the past month and a half and their food is all i've had. Their food sucks! I haven't had chipotle in almost 2 months! They need rehab centers for this stuff...
124149619252_10152949800154253:Is this story true???  http://gopthedailydose.com/2014/12/30/chains-brooklyn-store-refusing-serve-police-officer-reason-will-leave-boycotting/
124149619252_10152325977227741:And don't be persuaded by industry trolls who repeat the same sad lies. Amber, none of the foods you listed are gmo. We already have enough food to feed the world but allow politics to get in the way. Chipotle isn't trying to bring down agriculture. . . .they're trying to bring it UP to a much needed higher standard. Get on board or get left behind with the 'farm' you walk on.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl with the shell, plain brown rice, black beans, double steak, cheese, sour cream, and a bag of chips. Uh oh, instant Chipotle craving...
124149619252_10152323527922741:You guys that at so against antibiotics obviously dont realize that animal get sick just like we do. We take antibiotics when we're sick, so why is it so bad for animals? Those of you that think modern agriculture is a bad thing, I would like to see how well you could feed the world without using pesticides and fertilizers. You all keep complaining about things you have no clue about. Why don't you visit a real farm instead of watching it on an extremely biased documentary?
124149619252_10153236016399253:Let's open this n the Conyers, Covington, Decatur, Lithonia, Stone Mountain area. That's Georgia baby.
124149619252_185864848093833:Look I have been trying to support organically grown companies since 1975. It's the big companies that are out for a lot of money mass producing chicken companies, fish farms,big turkey producing companies. For example leave Tennessee for a minute...I was living in Southern California, where all of the dairy cows, were supposed to be "happy cows" well some of the farmers were feeding their cows whatever made them produce the most milk and not about the health and well-being of the cows, it was all about greed and the cows were getting so many infections from pumping so much milk. My farmer friend was running her organic dairy and she told me they had to throw all of the milk away that was from the cow that was on antibiotics and they tested it until there was no more signs of the antibiotics. My farmer friends cows were grazing and eatting "certified organic feed" they were well taken care of cows. The big dairies packed in the cows and pumped them up with antibiotics and you would see hundreds of them on top of each other and sinking in the mud, on purpose so they couldn't move so they would produce as much milk as possible, it was terrible conditions. Which milk do you want to drink? Do you want to drink milk from well taken care of cows or massed produced greedy company that doesn't care about you or me or the cows just the almighty dollar? I try to buy from local farmers it's the freshest, I wish the whole world was without pesticides and grew organic and treated their livestock right.  
124149619252_10153246130479253:Lol. Jumping on the non gmo bandwagon for publicity. Your food was fine already. The customer service and atmosphere was pretty good too. Perhaps use that to your advantage instead?
124149619252_10153221918784253:ate a salad, now ill, with gastroenteritis. :0. was fast, hit within one hour... not wanting to begin a weekend this way..................
124149619252_10152883505569253:Put one in charles town wv!!! You all would get so much business its the only restaurant that everyone wants!!
124149619252_10153001213604253:Thanks for your commitment to the humane treatment of animals. It's great to see a large company with conscience. Karma is with you, Chipotle!
124149619252_10151086390274253:Wait....there's Chipotle in LONDON????? I can't get a Chipotle in Savannah, GA, the good old USA, but there's in LONDON??????!!!!!  Come on now, WTF.
124149619252_10153395310879253:Laughing at all the scared, insecure homophobes in this thread. Your side is losing, as time goes on, and you know it. Get over it.
124149619252_160584150738666:Are you serious? There is a chipotle in Paris and the closest one to me is 2 hours away? Chipotle, we have a love/hate relationship. 
124149619252_10153009001449253:I was last night so good with chicken guacamole, black beans, sour cream, lechuga, Pico de gallo, rice, .....
124149619252_10153602183249253:This fake ad actually started circulating a couple years ago. I saw it on Reddit back in 2013 I think
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito bowl (tortilla on the side-btw its usually really hot right off the warmer so be careful) fajita peppers, black beans, white rice, pico, cheese, lettuce, and sour cream=pure delight! 
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl: brown rice, carnitas & chicken, 2 scoops hot salsa, ALOT of cheese, guacamole & a side of chips w/ a Arnold Palmer ;)~~~ makes me wanna get one before they close!!! 
124149619252_10151895014639253:Omigosh, is that snow on the ground, in early October? Wherever that is, I don't really want to be there!
124149619252_10150298717314253:Chiptole is missing out on a lot of sales just from those who work at FORD plants. they need one alot closer to Dearborn, MI
124149619252_183772721660585:Sweet!  And the fine dining restaurant at my hotel is also a semi-finalist for "Oustanding Service"!  The French Room at The Adolphus.  www.hoteladolphus.com or search Adolphus Hotel on FB.
124149619252_122372141178171:There's nothing wrong with a burger and a french fries from mcdonalds sometimes.  Just not every damn day.
124149619252_10153071221514253:Where I  live they are training a lot of new people at once- so it is kinda hit and miss... they have to learn what they are doing, Cut people a little slack.
124149619252_160584150738666:Wow, I'm shocked they actually went. They may criticize us, but no one can resist the deliciousness of Chipotle.
124149619252_10151024826814253:burrito,white  rice, pinto, steak, medium, corn, cheese and lettuce guac on the siiiiide yyeeaaahhh buddy
124149619252_167132760066216:After all of the really cool (and generous) giveaways Chipotle has had over the years, it seems strange to have only 10 winners out of such a large potential entry pool. A contest where customers write a haiku on a Chipotle paper bag, bring it in, and get a free burrito sounds more like the Chipotle I know.
124149619252_10153009001449253:The store here in Charlotte  ran out and now won't honor the the free one ! This is not good business ..... I eat there often! I really upset about this!!!!
124149619252_175763983493:Wait what the hell Is all this talk about scams, burritos, and the O zone layer?!? Thoose are completely irelevent!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Salad with black beas, tomatoes, green salsa and corn. Squeeze juice of 4 lime wedges over salad, with a few dashes of green tabasco and half of the chipotle house dressing. YUM! :)
124149619252_10153602183249253:Oh good! I just came to your page to tell you how awful I thought it was and how disappointing to see but you have shown it to be untrue!! I'm so glad! Outrageous and tasteless indeed!
124149619252_181086415246015:This article is interesting. On one hand they are right we need more access to healthy affordable local food (organic preferred) but do we need to involve the government? they were the ones who junked up your food in the first place. If you so much as dip a money hungry politician's fingers into your feta, they will make it cheez wiz.
124149619252_10152786808474253:Why is it when Chipotle advertises positions available on Craigslist and other job boards, when you "click" on the job description, nothing comes up when you click on the description in "ENGLISH", but when you click on the description for ESPAGNOL,  a definition appears?
124149619252_166838126748689:Chipotle can't be beat. Go to Whole Foods and see how much it costs you to make your own hormone-free steak burrito.
124149619252_10151074987494253:Chipotle is literally the place to go if you want to hear horrible music. They will never fail at that. Good food though
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl to-go, white rice, black beans, chicken, extra chicken, mild salsa, medium salsa, cheese, lettuce, and cup for water. Boom!
124149619252_10153693560944253:I still love your food. I always get a chicken salad, with the corn and the hottest salsa, cheese, avocado.
124149619252_10153830182809253:It sounds like a conspiracy to me. Maybe the GMO supporters are behind it not to mention any names? Just saying. Evil is as evil does.
124149619252_10151089035244253:lets see, My FAVE is Elyria Ohio by Midway mall, then Lakewood ohio then Amherst ohio :-)   I guess I just love all Chipotle!!!
124149619252_156053474470:So, I'm thinking you should have a trial run with this Delivery idea right here in Wichita, KS. What do you think about that? There are a couple locations that are right near a mall and they would get a lot of business from mall employees who are tired of crappy mall food.
124149619252_10150262089049253:Not to complain but this oregano farm seems really inefficient as the empty dirt takes up more space than the oregano itself. Locally grown foods might cut don't on waste from transportation, but in itself is still typically wasteful. I'd really like to see Chipotle supporting local foods grown using hydroponics, that would make them the ultimate green restaurant.
124149619252_10152004082504253:Sorry, but this is America. We speak ENGLISH here. I am so sick of seeing Spanish printed and forced on us everywhere.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Yea what's with the repeat at the end a hoax not real not chipotle broken record..... They loved it they got likes and shares that's all they care about
124149619252_10152250518069253:Everyone should go watch the new farmed and dangerous show on hull and try to win buy one get one coupons!!!
124149619252_454413931302356:If you will bring a Chipotle to Blairsville, Ga, you will definitely get my business as well as many of my friends who admire your decision!
124149619252_10151316869709253:Imagine if they said they WERE going to be open... then it would all hell breaking loose and everyone would be like "rawwwwwr your employees deserve time with their families" corporations cant please anybody.
124149619252_10153498699374253:Is everything here  spicy ? I have heard different thing like you can get stuff that 's not spicy  .Then  heard everything is spicy ?I want to try but I don't do spicy and the name of the place is after a hot pepper .
124149619252_10153736393409253:E. coli that makes humans ill comes from the intestines of farm animals. Intensive animal agriculture is putting everyone at risk as the animals poop gets sprayed onto vegetables as fertilizer even putting non meat eaters at risk. It's time to get serious about our food standards. Eating animals has no PROS everything about it is a CON. Please open your heart and your mind to trying a vegan plant based diet. Humans are herbivores. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOdVW6RWG8o
124149619252_10153270305244253:Had a nice veggie salad today. The guac and corn make a nice flavor combo when u get em in the same bite. Love Chipotle!
124149619252_100780796665922:A friend of mine says that the food at qdoba is the same as Chipotle. I say his taste buds have been dumbed. Qdoba's food is crappy!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl with rice, black beans, extra chicken, hot salsa, sour cream, cheese lettuce. Fresh salsa, guacamole and chips on the side. With lemonade...always lemonade...
124149619252_10153232136249253:How come Mo's Southwest Grill has hormone free pork on their website and Chipotle can't get it???    The lines at our location used to be winding around the entire inside of the place  Not now.  We love our Carnitas!!
124149619252_199537401806:you should open one up in my kitchen.  it's just too much hassle to drive 5 minutes to the neighborhood store
124149619252_10152724330769253:Apparently you're not saving me a seat in Concord, NC since Candice just informed me there is no info on that store despite reports in the local newspaper. This sucks!!
124149619252_10151486609219253:I never order a burrito.  Always get a salad (no dressing needed) with brown rice, black beans, salsa, and guacamole -- occasionally with barbacoa (I eat meat only when I crave it -- typically once every 1-2 weeks).
124149619252_10151934460309253:Thank you for both explaining your vision and pointing out your challenges. This was very well written.
124149619252_10153514914799253:Bro I've been eating chipotle for lunch for 1 week now... I spent 2 hours a day on the toilet mates. Still eat it till this day????
124149619252_10152132868854253:we really need a chipotle in garden city ks or closer.. I have to travel 4hr just to get a hold of some
124149619252_10152805746454253:That must be a Hobbit hand, because they're pretty small for the price in actuality. Can't come close to cafe rio.
124149619252_196891642078:I have to say, I agree with everything written about Chipotle. I think I'll have one for lunch!  My one-word description:  LUNCH!
124149619252_10153602183249253:Those darn Chipotle Haters!! Let's show them & go get some Chipotle's today!!! Mmmm Love me some! ????????????
124149619252_10153389325099253:Houma, Louisiana! I literally make chipotle my dinner every night!  I refuse to eat any other fast food! ??
124149619252_205082546217004:I think people should quit being sue happy and quit wasting peoples time in line complaining and crying over what food has what in it. Use common sense and dont loose sleep over it 
124149619252_10151024826814253:White rice Black beans Carnitas Corn salsa Hot salsa Cheese  Sour cream Lettuce  In a bowl Yummy as heck =}
124149619252_156053474470:Ps You guys also need to build a Store In the area of 104th And Chambers In Colorado. We are a growing area near Denver International Airport and Your store would Profit Nicely. Add the delivery Omg!! BANK!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Bowl brown rice, black beans, medium salsa, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, guacamole with chips. Heard the barbacoa is good and want to try it soon. Love Chipolte! Need to get my hubby there he hasn't tried it yet. Can you believe that?!
124149619252_10152323527922741:Also, you're all fools. The whole petroleum thing is a metaphor, showing how ridiculous our mass producers are, and how they are willing to put just about anything in our food
124149619252_10153896327714253:chipotle date anyone? :D :D Ahiraa Supeinthiran Neshah Mathi TJ Bhayee Sagika Thavarajah Prachi Patel Jerald Joy Gomes
124149619252_10151258924194253:At least there's a place that's showing decency and respect for this holiday.  4 for you Chipotle. You go Chipotle!
124149619252_10153009001449253:Really disappointed how this was heavily promoted...yet store was out? You have something for vegetarians...run out...have Halloween burrito sale and it last for specified time?The East Golf Rd Schaumburg,IL store had a sign up stating they were out but some customers came out saying they made substitutions for some people. I guess this long time supporter was not special enough...sad but not suprised by this locations shady staff.
124149619252_142788962468209:REALLY LIKE that he's growing ORGANIC! YEAH! Please consider using more organic veggies. Good job Chipotle.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Half Chicken/Half Steak Burrito Bowl, with Lettuce, White Rice, hot salsa corn sour cream, and chese w/ a side of guacamole
124149619252_10153009001449253:I am disappointed in this promotion. I'm allergic to tofu, but I want a free burrito. But I don't want a migraine that will leave me bedridden for 3 days. Where's the burrito love?
124149619252_454413931302356:Agreed Dave Hayes it shouldn't be a topic or a concern, which is why we're withdrawing our sponsorship to align ourselves better with our own philosophy of non-discrimination. - Joe
124149619252_119322358240818:Thank you Chipotle for supporting TomBeth Farms.  Glad to see a company who supports small AMERICAN businesses!
124149619252_10152407734029253:Another weak company folding to the fictitious pressure from the left. Thank GOD for freedom-loving, LOCAL businesses like #HabaneroGrill in Martinsburg, WV!
124149619252_10153693560944253:Please fix flawed restaurant designs where air vents drip condensate into food on the prep line! I saw this happening at my local Chipotle and I walked, won't go back. I let people know two times that I thought it was gross.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Here's the cheat to this. Order the Sofriza burrito with the Sofriza on the side. Tell them you want a side order of whatever meat on the burrito. Then they will ring it up as a Sofriza with a extra meat. Problem solved.
124149619252_10153009001449253:They ran out of the sofritas while we were there, but luckily they just had to cook some more! So had to wait a while for them... I got a bowl, and it was rather tasty! It seems like the sofritas just disintegrated into my rice in the bowl. So really just felt like I was eating seasoned rice, no big tofu chunks or anything. Although it wasn't my first time trying the sofritas. I do have one complaint about them though, they make the bowl too watery!!!! Which causes the bowls to leak. One time through the bag, and soaked the theigh of my jeans. It had looked like a baby shat on my leg! Boo fail. Other than that. Rather tasty!!
124149619252_100720426611000:This is the best food!!!!!  I go with the bowl - chicken and 2 scoops of red chile sauce.  It is fantastic.  I am nuts for it.  I have to have it at least 3 times a week.
124149619252_10153132892604253:gotta say that Chipotle makes some amazing guac. I almost don't mind paying like $2 for a scoop. lol. Ever consider posting the recipe?
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito with steak if too red I get chicken..with brown rice, fajita mix, cheese, medium salsa, and corn:)
124149619252_10152883478794253:I agree every time I go to chipotle it's dirty and I get horrible customer service, the other day I was unbline and the lady skipped right over me and ask the person behind me what they wanted and I was totally ignored, chipotle clean up your act!
124149619252_10153395310879253:Looking forward to when all the people never eating Chipotle again also disable Facebook and set down the iPhones... Did you honestly think a company like Chipotle would NOT be in favor of equality?
124149619252_10152693491999253:Matt We decided to pull some of our tomato supply today due to quality concerns. Thanks for your patience, and we'll have that fixed as soon as possible! -Joe
124149619252_10151024826814253:bowl, fajita veggies, brown rice, black beans, green salsa, lettuce, guac, sometimes cheese sometimes not. no sour cream.
124149619252_109031815838831:i have had the same experience here in america also i have had the manager just give me a meal just for being a regular customer i respect and appreciate the fact that they appreciate me and my loyalty thank you Chipotle
124149619252_10151486609219253:Eating some right now!! White rice, fajita vegetables, mild salsa, sour cream, black beans, guacamole, lettuce, cheese, and I added two fried eggs on top. Oh and extra cilantro.
124149619252_10153009001449253:Sadly, the closest Chipotle to us we tried to get this burrito today and they were out of Sofritas. They are 1 1/2 miles away, we trudged there in a snow storm to participate and no sofritas to order.   Thanks for nothing.  No ability to participate in the promotion. I feel like I was lured into a location for nothing.  I won't be running back anytime soon, as a 20+ year vegetarian I am used to not having options at fast food restaurants.  I guess I still don't.
124149619252_10153569576059253:Wouldn't have to sharpen that blade every time if you didn't scrape it across the cutting board so much! Eek! Waste of a good knife.
124149619252_10152250518069253:I agree. It's too bad this isn't a real deal. I remember when I was in college chipotle used to have deals all the time.
124149619252_10152262999499253:Just had it today.  It was awesome!  Gonna go back tomorrow and get some for the Philadelphia Union day!
124149619252_156053474470:omg! this is a miracle! ive wished many a time that chipotle could deliver and my wish is coming true <3
124149619252_10152250518069253:So GLAD they're NOT getting rid of the guacamole! I would have stopped going! I LOVE Guacamole on my burrito and can't imagine it without!
124149619252_10152082036279253:I prefer to support local pizza shops. It's one of few food choices that still has plenty of local restaurants.
124149619252_10151486609219253:Brown rice, chicken, mild salsa, corn, sour cream, LOTS OF CHEESE and a little lettuce for color. Usually I ask for help to carry it to my car when I'm done. It's HUGE!! Mmmmmm love em!
124149619252_10152429436247741:The amount of people that say Chi-polte is too high. Every time I hear it it's like nails on a chalkboard.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Half steak half barbacoa bowl with white rice fajitas black beans mild corn cheese lettuce and sour cream  on the side yummmmmmm!!!!! 
124149619252_205082546217004:I'd like to see a comparison chart that shows the 'perceived healthfulness' compared to average calories per menu item, or 'actual healthfulness'...
124149619252_10151089035244253:none of them, because none of them are located near Lafayette, Louisiana.  We have an  Izzo's Illegal Burrito and I'd much rather have a Chipotle here.
124149619252_10153200118729253:My fiancé & I have been having Chipotle dates for the past 9 years! We agree... Great place for dates, first OR first of many
124149619252_10151024826814253:Barbacoa bowl, white rice, black beans, mild salsa, corn salsa, cheese, lettuce = yummy in my tummy!!!! My weekly treat to myself!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:bowl, double rice, fajitas, chicken, mild salsa, sour cream and cheese. Hubby gets double wrapped burrito, double white rice, black beans, mild salsa, sour cream, cheese and guac.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken bowl, brown rice, black beans, cheese and sour cream! Every time I go! Going tomorrow for my birthday lunch. (:

124149619252_10151024826814253:Bowl with brown rice, blck beans, barbacoa , red salsa, cheese, sour cream and lettuce! cilantro and tortilla on the side :)
124149619252_10151024826814253:This picture makes me want Chipotle RIGHT NOW!!!!! I always get a bowl, rice, steak, tomato, corn, med tomatilla, lettuce, cheese and GUACAMOLE! Yep, that's settled, I'm having Chipotle for lunch!
124149619252_10152250518069253:It would be nice if you did something like that. I mean we eat at your establishment often enough to get a little something once in a while.
124149619252_10151486609219253:Peppers,onion,white rice,extra cheese,hot and mild salsa,sour cream,corn! No meat ;) oh and green Tabasco
124149619252_10153896327714253:Yummy one of my favorite places to go of all time as a healthy choice that and the cheesecake factory oh yeah and olive garden those three are my favorite places to go to ear
124149619252_10152538683134253:love guacamole but it's totally not worth it. sometimes they only give you like half a scoop, for $2 extra? no thanks.
124149619252_10152250518069253:Really no such thing as free? Yesterday was free pancake day at IHOP. Looks like your marketing team needs some work, especially when you are charging $12 per burrito.
124149619252_10153173387349253:So I was eating at Chipotle on campus on the drag. There was a homeless man sitting outside. And during my 1 hour of eating I saw 2 college girls hand him a bad of food with water, 3 different familys with kids hand him some money and food, and 1 adult come inside Chipotle and order him warm food. And after I was done eating I went next door to cvs and bought him some food and a bottle of water. My faith in humanity has been restored.
124149619252_10153608850569253:Did you guys clean up your Simi Valley store?  Haven't been there since the issue of at least 75 people getting sick.
124149619252_10152883478794253:Never again.  You can shove your burritos where the sun don't hit ya.  You should enjoy it as you are as homosexual jerks as ovomit is.
124149619252_100780796665922:Really? Is this even a contest? We have a Qdoba on campus and I still walk the half mile to the nearby Chipotle to get lunch.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito bowl with rice, black beans, fajita veggies, chicken, tomato salsa, corn salsa, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole...chips for dipping and some hot sauce on top:)
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito with chicken, white rice, black beans, pico, corn, cheese, and a water cup. $6.77 never fails
124149619252_10151809543439253:When will you come to Michigan to do this? There is always the Strawberry Festival - Belleville, MI during June.
124149619252_10152883504929253:I love Chipotle. Too bad the closest ones to me are at least a half hour away and I don't have a car. Please open one in, or close to, Monroe, Michigan.
124149619252_10153423452749253:Brenda Ingvoldstad this looks like fun, want to go check out Chef Richard Blais from Top Chef and listen to some tunes with me??
124149619252_10151251776579253:Am I ever going to be able to get brown rice on my burrito by ordering via the iPhone app?  I type brown rice every time I order a burrito in the notes and it never gets read... And I'd feel racist putting whatever brown rice is in Spanish in to the notes.  Please update the app
124149619252_10151024826814253:Burrito, white, black, fajitas, DOUBLE STEAK (triple if i feel that i didn't get enough), mild salsa, sour cream and GUAC. I'm a little wet thinking about it =) and i have one AT LEAST once a day! True story.
124149619252_10151024826814253:I always get a burrito bowl with brown rice, black beans, chicken, lettuce, cheese, and sour cream. sometimes guacamole.
124149619252_10153903490999253:Chipotle Mexican Grill your new providence New Jersey location portions is the worst. I have to constantly ask for the most minimal toppings like rice when making a bowl.
124149619252_10151024826814253:All right, listen closely guys lol. Burrito, both rice, both beans, half chicken, half carnitas, and LOADS of cheese. Protein and calcium. Talk about a healthy burrito ;D

124149619252_10152586158139253:I almost cried I thought this was in China...I've been here for a year and I miss it SO MUCH! Please come to Beijing!!!!
124149619252_10153246130479253:I say you should just remove everything with spooky-scary science names. It should really increase sales.
124149619252_156053474470:HOLY deliver in MINENSOTA! i was actually talking about that option with my friend like 2 weeks ago! ha!
124149619252_100780796665922:The thing that would make Chipotle PERFECT would be a yummy Queso dip for my chips...that's the one (and only) thing Qdoba has over Chipotle
124149619252_10153806089609253:I still eat at Chipotle and I have request Chipotle gift cards any denomination for my birthday. 0106.
124149619252_10152883478794253:I will never step foot in any one of them anymore.  You are losing millions of customers you pieces of trash!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken salad, a little  black beans, pico, green salsa , light cheese = happiness. In fact I just had that for lunch today.  
124149619252_10153555173409253:My burrito never looks like that. It looks like someone punched it. Nevertheless, it tastes the same. Delicious.
124149619252_164816057005566:so i going to have to fy to the SF area for dinner tonight... Well this is gonna be an expensive meal..
124149619252_205455487672:We need one in Germany! Preferrably in Frankfurt or Koln. I'll drive a couple of hours for a burrito :)
124149619252_10152082036279253:Interesting, but let's not move too fast. There's something to be said about doing "one thing" well. Besides all I need now is another 50 people in line. Gmerice J Welch Dandridge. ????????
124149619252_267832333301923:I would buy a sack of some dank for $10 then ill have $14 left...so the i would get a packet of them swishas for $4 leaving me with $10 to hit up mcdonalds for their dollar menu or jack in the box too..so use ur $ more conviniently then some bs bags...lol
124149619252_10153071208839253:Emma Pierce I know I tag you in everything but this is just as good as the other proposal ????????????
124149619252_10153270305244253:When you will arrive in Brazil? I'm use to go to chipotle everytime that i'm in the USA and i feel just amazing!
124149619252_10153310575624253:Damnit Tristan Dakota Landahl Sarah Harnish we will be gone!!! We could change the dates back now since Taylor isn't going lol

124149619252_115365598544868:@CarolAnn, I'm sure Jesus would like it if you celebrated Earth Day, too. That's what he would do. :P
124149619252_10151024826814253:The Veggie Bowl. **************  Tortilla on the side. White Rice Black Beans Onion/Peppers Medium Salsa Corn Sour Cream Hot Salsa in a separate Cup Lettuce Guacmole Corn Cheese.  Yummy!
124149619252_212886842115332:We got ours! I was disappointed by the lack of people in costume. The girls behind the counter got our picture though :)
124149619252_10152560126959253:yo Kevin Alexander if you end up getting free chipotle for life for this article, can we become BFFs?
124149619252_10150637170574253:oh my goodness!! This looks so good! I miss Chipotle sooo much!! Ya'll need to open a resturant on the Gulf Coast in Mississippi!!!! :)
124149619252_10153246130479253:I love that you are now non gmo I hope other places follow in your footsteps and become non gmo this is so amazing!!!! I will now be a customer here!!!!
124149619252_10152883478794253:Censor the comments all you want... it's one of the few places of the MANY you have some control over. But so MANY other places you have NO say in... and that's where you will find me...
124149619252_10151024826814253:Love it all...everything on it...double meat,guacamole, usually two dif salsa,fajita mix both beans,cheese,sour cream,lettuce...with smokey hot tabasco sauce all over..so good! 
124149619252_10153232136249253:Well I have something to say. With the CEO of Chipotle making $13,000 p/hour why they can not put extra registers to off set the lines. Just saying! ( South Florida) locations. On the good note I LOVE CHIPOTLE!!!!!!!
124149619252_182409608462105:I really love your food - but there isn't a restaurant near me - not even remotely close.  You need to build one in Kingman, AZ!!!  I tried making your rice at home - not as good as yours - of course
124149619252_10151024826814253:veggie bowl with brown rice, extra black beans, fajita veggies, lettuce, fresh tomato salsa, sour cream, corn salsa :) YUMMY!!!!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Before prices increased and portions shrank my favorite was a burrito bowl with fajita veggies, chicken, mild salsa and guac. Now I just go somewhere else. Milwaukee area Chipotles are home to incredibly shrinking portions. 
124149619252_10151809543439253:Please, Chipotle: I love veggie burritos (no charge for guac!!) but PLEASE bring sofritas to MN soon? I've been dying to try it!
124149619252_145246312263952:wow, what a grand prize.  A burrito, PER WEEK.  works out to a "grand" prize of about $360.  at least McDonalds gives you a chance at a million with their Monopoly game.  but I hate McDonalds, so pony up the cash Chipotle!
124149619252_100780796665922:Chipotle will kill Qdoba with a magical burrito cannon!!! Chipotle is the best, no other way to put it.
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken burrito with black beans, mild salsa, rice, cheese, sour cream, guacamole and lettuce.....YUM:)
124149619252_205455487672:ha ha sucks for all of you. I live by Denver and there it at least 10 chipotles within a 20 mile radius. I can find one almost anywhere around here :)
124149619252_10153232136249253:Jason Mueller Definitely one more reason to love Chipotle!  Would love to see more follow their lead.
124149619252_10152949800154253:How am I supposed to cure my hangover, now that Chipotle Mexican Grill is closed on New Year's Day???!!!
124149619252_10151058843154253:Gurnee, Illinois... and this Chipotle is special because it's Greener then... almost everything. http://littlebitsofgreen.com/article/double_the_local/
124149619252_10151024826814253:I love Chipotle!!! :)  Bowl with a tortilla on the side... white rice, chicken, two scoops of tomato salsa (for the lycopene), sour cream, cheese, and lettuce!!
124149619252_10151024826814253:Chicken Bowl White Rice With a Little Brown NO BEANs CORN salsa, Tomatoes, Hot Salsa, Cheese LOTS of Sour Cream And A Little Lettuce :D YUM!
124149619252_10151486609219253:Any chance you could have more salt-free options?   I'd like to see a salt-free salad dressing.   Thanks.
124149619252_10153896327714253:My chicken bowl was delicious as always. The only thing that made it better was this time it was FREE. Thank you!!! ????
124149619252_10153438315219253:Ok back up the train, Debi Weisberg Moss you and Chipotle have the same birthday! No wonder I love you both so much ????
124149619252_10152883478794253:Just went to the Salem, Oregon location. Worst service and food ever. Norman, Oklahoma campus location is the best though.
124149619252_10152949800154253:So now your stores are refusing to serve police officers? Your staff disrespects NYPD officers by not serving them, unbelievable
124149619252_10153246130479253:Did they make it KNOWN they were serving it ?! Why make it known when you stop ?! Food chain is polluted period watch what , how, and where you eat ...grow something!
124149619252_10153215460149253:Louie Encinias with King Louie consciousness will be there also and Great Fresh Curly Cut Frys! Can't wait!
124149619252_10151058843154253:James Donson Those were just turned on for the picture. As you can see, there is nobody inside. - Joe

124149619252_10153830182809253:Hey, it ain't Mexican food otherwise.... https://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/terminal05/2012/9/30/14/enhanced-buzz-7175-1349031410-0.jpg
124149619252_100780796665922:I stopped reading at "The ordering process at Qdoba is anything but intuitive."  Ordering at Qdoba is much easier than ordering at Chipotle is.  Also the taste of the food at Qdoba is way better than at Chipotle, not to mention their larger selection, and they have larger burritos.  Don't get me wrong, Chipotle is good, but if I have the choice I will choose Qdoba every time.
124149619252_10153001213604253:Thank you for caring about humane treatment. We do not eat meat but come in for other choices.  Now you are a role model for restaurants and will change so much of whats wrong! Blessings to you and yours!
124149619252_10152662325439253:Chipotle Burritos are so big, they are like the size of a newborn baby, but it looks really weird if you hold it in your arms like one!!
124149619252_147322035888:umm that i wouldnt even touch that burrito..r u kiddin me??? that is like the most disgusting type of burrito every...wow
124149619252_10153656854824253:Not the correct way to cut into an avocado at all. Terrible idea to teach people this way. It should always be done on a flat  surface and never in your hand.
124149619252_10152250518069253:I can't believe the stupid, entitled people whining that Chipotle isn't honoring something so obviously fake and made up. If they gave out 100% FREE FOOD to every schlub with an iPad they'd go out of business. If it sounds too good to be true it probably is.
